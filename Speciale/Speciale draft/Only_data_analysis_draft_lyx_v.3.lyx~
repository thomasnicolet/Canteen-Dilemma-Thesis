\begin_layout Section
Canteen Dilemma experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Canteen Dilemma is two-player co-ordination game modeled similarly to
 the Consecutive Numbers example.
 The game gives the Consecutive Numbers example a thematic context by creating
 a narrative of two colleagues arriving at work every morning.
 Instead of being assigned a number, they are assigned a time they arrive
 in the morning.
 There are eight possible arrival times ranging from 8:00 am to 9:10 am
 in ten minute intervals.
 Like the Consecutive Numbers example, participants know their own arrival
 time and that the other person always has an arrival time ten minutes before
 or after their own.
 The game then consists of a series of rounds where participants have to
 decide between going to the canteen and the office.
 They also have to give an estimate of how certain they are that the other
 player made the same choice as them, but I'll ignore that for now and come
 back to it later.
 The narrative of arriving at work is continued: if both players arrived
 before 9:00 am, they have time to go to the canteen, which also nets the
 highest payoff.
 Both players going to the office together results in a lower payoff.
 Going to different places, or going to the canteen at 9:00 am or later
 is the worst option however and results in a penalty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To iterate, there are 8 possible arrival times, which results in 14 unique
 possible arrival-time pairs.
 The game puts players at a dilemma in the following way.
 Players prefer to meet in the canteen before 9:00 am, and there are plenty
 of chances for doing so, since 10 of the possible 14 possible arrival-time
 pairs allows this (call this the set
\emph on
 late
\emph default
: {(8:50, 9:00), (9:00, 8:50), (9:00, 9:10), (9:10, 9:00)}) punishes a canteen
 choice no matter what).
 Imagine a player want to go for meeting the other player in the canteen
 as much as possible, i.e.
 in all the 10 cases.
 One of the 10 cases consists of the arrival pair (8:50, 8:40).
 But when a player arrives at 8:50, they do not know if the other player
 arrived at 8:40 (meaning canteen would be the lowest payoff) or 9:00 (meaning
 canteen would be the lowest payoff).
 A player might attempt to avoid this dilemma by deciding to not go to the
 canteen when their arrival time is contained in the 
\emph on
late 
\emph default
set, i.e.
 choosing the office whenever they arrive at 8:50.
 But if they do this, they might assume the other player would do the same.
 This entails the dilemma is repeated at 8:40, since this means that the
 other player might have arrived at 8:50 and gone to the office.
 This line of reasoning is called backwards induction and applies to all
 possible arrival times, which entails the unintuitive conclusion that the
 only safe strategy is for both players to go to the office no matter what
 time it is.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is due to the lack of common knowledge about the arrival time of the
 players.
 However, it's highly unintuitive in relation to common sense reasoning
 to decide to go to the office when arriving at 8:00 am, after having been
 told that the highest payoff is going to the canteen together when you
 arrive before 9:00 am, and you know the following: you both arrived before
 9:00 am, the other player know you arrived before 9:00 am, the other player
 knows you know you both arrived before 9:00 am (and so on for two more
 iterations).

 for empirical evidence that people are more likely to act in accordance
 with forward inductive reasoning rather than backward inductive reasoning.
 In general, reasoning by backwards induction ignores previous moves in
 a game, while forwards induction takes these into account.

We used logarithmic scoring as a proper scoring rule, in relation to asking
 players how certain they were that the other player made the same choice
 as them.
 Research literature on eliciting belief also show that forecasts elicited
 from observers through proper scoring rules are significantly more accurate
 and calibrated then those elicited from observers using an improper scoring
 rule.
 Calibrated is defined as: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 rule seem to have significantly less dispersion than quadratic scoring
 rules even though both are proper scoring rules

Asking participants for a certainty estimate also has other benefits.
 It helps alleviate some of what Verbrugge calls

.
 This is because it allows differentiation between two players both choosing
 e.g.
 canteen.
 There might be a distinction in terms of applied ToM between those who
 choose canteen and those who do not.
 But there might also be a distinction within the group that chooses e.g.
 canteen in terms of their estimated certainty.
 Now for the experiment.

In order to gather more information about the reasoning of the participants,
 they were asked a few post-game questions.
 If a game ended because a player had lost all of their bonus, participants
 were asked whose fault it was that the game ended.
 Participants where asked three other questions when the game ended, regardless
 the reason.
 These questions pertained to (i) what strategy the player had, (ii) what
 time they deemed it safe to go to the canteen and (iii) if it was common
 knowledge that they had arrived before 9:00 am, given an arrival time of
 8:00 am, i.e.
 their intuition about the concept of common knowledge.

 The platform has been used by social and economic researchers in lieu of
 typical lab experiments with local university students.

Participants and AMT Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment included 714 participants.
 All participants gave informed consent to participate before being included.
 AMT also allows the researchers to apply a few different settings.
 Only turkers from Canada or the United States were able to enter the hit.
 Further restraints were used in order to only include those with an approved
 HIT rate of 98% or above and at least 500 completed HITs.
 41 of the 714 did not play the full game due not making a required choice
 in time.
 The experiment was run in batches of 50 participants at a time within a
 timespan of a maximum of one hour.
 Participants had access to our emails during the experiment for questions
 and feedback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Payoff structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants received a participation fee of $2.
 Besides this, the experiment utilizes a logarithmic scoring rule which
 means the payoff is calculated as the logarithm of the probability estimate
 for the actual outcome, where a 99% probability estimate of an event occurring
 would mean assiging 1% estimate to the event not occuring.
 Participants were also given an initial $10 bonus which is reduced during
 the game.
 Every round results in a penalty which is taken out of their bonus depending
 on the choices they make and how certain they are that their colleague
 has made the same choice.
 Payoffs range from $0.01 to $9.21.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

If both players go to the canteen, their penalty is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(player-certainty)$
\end_inset

.
 If they both go to the office it is doubled: 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(player-certainty)\cdot2$
\end_inset

.
 If they go to different places it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(1-player-certainty)\cdot2$
\end_inset

.
 Players who dropped out due to time limit received no bonus or participation
 fee, while the player matched to them received their participation fee.

Materials and set-up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a participant had provided informed consent, participants were directed
 to a waiting page until they were matched with another player.
 After the groups were formed, players were directed to an initial introduction
 page, detailing the rules of the game, quouted below (see Appendix A for
 screenshot).
 This page was shown for 90 seconds before automatically starting the first
 round (the initial intended time limit was 240 seconds, but it was not
 used due to an unintended problem).
 The instructions were also shown on every subsequent round which lasted
 61 seconds, where players were given an arrival time and had to decide
 to go to the canteen or the office.

 This was based on a 5 point Likert scale, with possbile answers being very

When participants had made their choice between the canteen and office and
 had given a probabiltiy estimate, they were prompted to a page showing
 a table for running results (See Appendix D).
 What round number they had just played, what time they had arrived including
 their choice and certainty estimate.
 It also showed the arrival time of the other player in all previous rounds
 including their decision.
 The penalty for each round was also shown.
 They were explicitly told below the table if they had both chosen to go
 to the canteen or office together, if they had made different choices,
 or if it had been too late to go to the canteen (a player had arrived at
 9:00 am).
 It also stated the penalty for that round, their total losses and their

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 shows that participants generally (90-93% of the time) went to
 the canteen when arriving before 8:50.
 Slightly less than half (47.2%, confidence interval 43.2% - 51.1%) of the
 participants chose the canteen at 8:50.
 More problematic however, is the fact that 15% (98 participants) chose
 the office at 9:00.
 This is not due to a lack of ToM or any reasoning process, since choosing
 the canteen at 9:00 always resulted in the biggest penalty.
 We will consider a few explanations for this.
 There is (1), the background 'noise' which is constituted by humans making
 mistakes, deliberately or not.
 No matter how simple a task you would set up on AMT stating 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to do something, there would be someone doing it, either unintentionally
 clicking the wrong button, picking at random, or perhaps even intentionally
 
\emph on
trolling
\emph default
.
 This is unlikely to account for the entire 15% choosing canteen however.
 (2) The possibly largest attributing factor was the formulation of the
 rules not stating clearly enough to avoid the canteen when arriving at
 9:00 or later.
 (3) Given the narrative of the game, going to the canteen or the office,
 it is possible some are biased towards the canteen due to their real-life
 preference of going to the canteen over the office.
 This is supported by some strategy answers, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just went with what I normally do in real life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 (4) Time constraints possibly compounded the problems of properly interpreting
 the rules of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problematic upshot of this is that, if a player believe they can go
 to the canteen at 9:00 and get rewarded as long as the other player does
 the same, it might affect their choice at 8:50.
 That is, a player might believe that if they arrive at 8:50, they can be
 rewarded for going to the canteen even if the other player arrives at 9:00,
 as long as the other player chooses canteen as well.
 This possibly has the effect that those arriving at 8:40 are more inclined
 to chose the canteen as well, and so on.
 This is not strongly empirically supported however.
 If we filter out data-set to exclude all those participants who chose canteen
 at 9:00 or 9:10, we get the following plot.

Instead of a confidence interval of 43.2 - 51.1 percent choosing the canteen
 at 8:50, we now have 37.7% - 46.7%.
 This is slightly lower (5%) but also with an 3% overlap.
 This means that even the participants who knew they themselves would chose
 office if they arrived at 9:00, 42% of them still chose to go to the canteen
 at 8:50.
 Since they themselves always choose the office at 9:00, it is implausible
 that they choose canteen at 8:50 because they believe that the other player
 might choose canteen even when arriving at 9:00 (plus the false belief
 that this is preferential for them).
 This indicates that they either take a chance, hoping the other player
 would not arrive at 9:50, or that they were unaware of their preference
 of choosing the same as their colleague.
 Since players have the opportunity to hedge their decisions with an estimate
 of how certain they are, it's plausibly that they simply took the chance,
 and then lowered their estimated certainty accordingly.
 We will now go through the results for the various post-game questions

\begin_layout Standard
The question is inherently complex given the structure of the game.
 In most cases of dis-coordination, a player would not be certain to have
 cooperated with the other player, even if one of them had made a different
 choice.
 Imagine player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
always goes to the office at 9:00, and meets player 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 who goes to the canteen at 8:50, leading to dis-coordination.
 However, if player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
goes to the canteen at 8:40, it would possibly also lead to dis-coordination
 if player 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 changed their strategy to choosing office at 8:50.
 There are however significantly more participants responding that it was
 the other players fault that the game ended, rather than their own fault
 or answering ignorance.
 This is curious since if there is an objective reason such that one player
 could be said to have made a mistake rather than the other, then the player
 who made the mistake would ideally answer that it was their own fault,
 while the other player would answer it was the others fault.
 In other words, there would be an equal amount of those answers under such
 scenarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the the previous plots, where we see that there was a lot of dis-coordi
nation at arrival time 8:40, 8:50 and 9:00.
 This is because players chose mostly canteen at 8:40 and mostly office
 at 9:00, while they were paired with those arriving at 8:50 who chose office
 only a bit more than half of the time.
 Those arriving at 9:00 had no choice but choosing office, and if they dis-coord
inate with a player arriving at 8:50, it is likely that they say it was
 the other players fault the game ended, since they could not have made
 a different choice.
 Those arriving at 8:40 and choosing canteen while the other player chooses
 office at 8:50 might be bewildered, assuming 8:40 was a safe time to go
 to the canteen, while the other thought it was clear that arriving at 8:50
 would entail going to the office.
 In both cases they say it was the other's fault that the game ended.
 The difference is arguably due to a difference in application of ToM.
 However there is a caveat.
 Given the possibility of answering ignorance, it's possible that some of
 those that might truthfully believe it was their own fault that the game
 ended chose the option of ignorance rather than wanting to admit their
 own mistake.

This questions however likely ties into the everyday linguistic meaning
 of the term 'common knowledge', which is closer to what's called

mutual knowledge
\emph default
 in the research literature, i.e.
 a fact known by everyone, which is different from the concept of common
 knowledge.
 In this sense, it would be right to answer that it is indeed mutual knowledge
 that both players arrived before 9:00 when one player arrive at 8:00.
 Unintuitively however, it is not common knowledge.
 The breaking point of the common sense meaning of 'common knowledge' could
 have been teased out of participants by asking them the question at randomly
 chosen arrival times.
 If participants truly understood common knowledge in the terms of mutual
 knowledge, most would answer 'yes' at 8:40 and earlier, and no after.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This plot shows a significant cluster around 8:30, 8:40 and 8:50.
 There are two points for discussion.
 First, 21% deeming it safe to go to the canteen at 8:50 shows that people
 either might not consider the fact that the other player can arrive at
 9:00, or that they believe that it's safe to go to the canteen at 8:50,
 even if the other player arrives at 9:00.
 This could either be due to (1) the belief that it's safe to go to the
 canteen as long as they individually arrived before 9:00, or (2) that they
 think it's safe to go to the canteen even when arriving at 9:00.
 The latter is implausible, since they could have chosen 9:00 then.
 So, either they (a) simple don't consider the possibility that the other
 player would have arrived at 9:00 (this could be due to either (i) limit
 on observation powers meaning they made an unreasonable interpretation
 of the rules, (ii) limit on memory, i.e.
 they knew it at some point but forgot, or (iii) the rules were not stated
 explicitly enough, meaning they simply acted according to a reasonable
 interpretation of the rules) or (b) they are aware of the possibility of
 the other arriving at 9:00, but simply believe their preference is choosing
 canteen at 8:50 even if the other arrives at 9:00.
 This could again be explained by (i), (ii) or (iii) stated above.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly and more interesting, it might show a discrepancy between participants
 reflections over when it is safe to go to the canteen and their decisions
 in each round.
 This relates to a distinction between reflective and spontaneous use of
 Theory of Mind found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Keysar et al.
 argue that while adults have the ability to use a sophisticated theory
 of mind both reflectively and deliberately, this ability is not incorporated
 thoroughly enough into the routine operation of their interpretation system
 to allow them to use it in spontaneous and non-reflective settings.
 They mention that the standard tests for assessing Theory of Mind in children
 are designed to tap into a meta-cognitive ability, i.e.
 the ability to evaluate and reflect, and not the ability to apply such
 reasoning in spontaneous decisions.
 The study from Keysar et al.
 focused on whether Theory of Mind was used in less reflective domains,
 when participants had to interpret the linguistic behavior of another person.
 The linguistic behavior consisted of a 'director' making to another participant
s such as 'Move the small candle to the right', which arguably triggers
 a less reflective decision-making procedure, compared to e.g.
 the quesiton 'What candle what I point out as the smallest candle?'.
 Their findings show that even adults who are perfectly capable of reflecting
 upon the difference between what they know and what another person know
 do not necessarily consult this knowledge when making spontaneous decisions,
 even in cases where it is crucial for successful cooperation with another
 person (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for evidence that adults application of ToM requires effortful attention)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is highly relevant for any experiment concerning ToM.
 In relation to Figure 5, consider that 21% chose 8:30 as the safe time
 to go to the canteen.
 For those participants, 90% chose to go to the canteen at 8:30 (see Appendix
 E for plot showing a line-chart showing percent going to canteen, filtered
 by answers in Figure 4), which is unsurprising given their belief that
 it's safe to go to the canteen there.
 But for those same participants, 86% chose to go to the canteen at 8:40.
 This is possibly due to the decreased ability to consult an existing ToM
 when asked to make a spontaneous decision, while this knowledge is drawn
 upon to a larger extent when asked a reflective question.
 These two instances are not inconsistent however if we assume that participants
 choose to go to the canteen even when they don't think it's safe.
 This is possible due to the option of simply lowering their estimated certainty
 when they think it is less safe to go to the canteen of course, which we
 will look at in the next section.
 Focusing on Figure 5 however, our results show that for those choosing
 8:30 as the safe time to go to the canteen in Figure 5, 32% (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm8\%)$
\end_inset

 choose to go to the canteen at 8:50 during the game.
 While this is lower than the average for our data, it is curious when compared
 to their answer in Figure 5.
 The plausible reasoning behind choosing 8:30 as the safe time to go to
 the canteen is due to backwards induction, i.e.
 8:50 is not safe, and neither is 8:40 then.
 But even if being able to go through that reasoning, participants still
 chose canteen 32% of the time when they arrive at 8:50 and 86% of the time
 they arrived at 8:40.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

Consider that participants interpreted the question in different ways.
 They might have interpreted the statement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imagine you could have agreed beforehand with your colleague about a point
 in time where it is safe to go to the canteen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the sense that answering '8:30' would not be inconsistent with also
 believing that 8:40 would be a safe time as well.
 While this is not logically inconsistent, there are two reasons for why
 participants have not made this interpretation.
 First, if some believed that they did not have to answer the latest possible
 safe time to go to the canteen, we would expect to see more answers at
 earlier times as well.
 But there are only 2-5% at times 8:00, 8:10 and 8:20.
 Secondly, given the pragmatics of the question, since the statement concerns
 agreement with the other player prior to the game, it would not make sense
 to agree on 8:30 being safe, if you thought you could just as well have
 agreed on 8:40.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

In terms of ToM, interpreting the answer that it would be safe to go to
 the canteen at 8:30 as meaning it would not be safe at 8:40 amounts to
 first order-order Theory of Mind.
 This is because an answer that it is not safe to go to the canteen at 8:50
 arguably depends on 0-order ToM, since choosing canteen at 8:50 involves
 the 50% chance the other player arrives at 9:00, and this is true regardless
 of the mental states of other players.
 Interestingly, the technically correct asnwer, 'There is no such time',
 is one of the least given answers at 2%.
 Since this is arguably below the background noise threshold in the data,
 it indicates that no participant made the full backwards induction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now turn to the certainty estimates in the data set.
 The discrepancy between the amount of participants choosing it would be
 safe to go to the canteen at 8:30 or 8:40 (i.e.
 not 8:50) and the amount of people choosing to go to the canteen at 8:50
 is somewhat reflected in the certainty estimates provided by participants.

Figure 6 shows a general picture of the amount of participants being 'very
 certain' in their choice is descending from 8:20 to 8:50.
 While participants quite generally (around 90%) went to the canteen when
 arriving before 8:50, there is trend of less participants being very certain
 about their choice as their arrival time approaches 9:00.
 Notice also the difference between amount being very certain at 8:50 and
 9:00.
 The reason behind participants choosing 'very certain' less at 8:50 than
 at earlier times, might be due to them sometimes choosing canteen here,
 which they (should) know is penalized if the other arrives at 9:00, and
 them sometimes choosing office, which is they might believe is penalized
 if the other arrives at 8:40, due to them plausibly having the belief that
 they are penalized if the other arrives at 8:40 (since they themselves
 choose canteen there).
 But there are more participants who choose 'very certain' at 9:00 than
 at 8:50 or 8:40.
 Players quite generally went to the canteen at 8:30, went near randomly
 to the canteen at 8:50 and quite generally went to the office at 9:10,
 and suppose for the sake of argument that participants were somewhat aware
 of this (i.e.
 assume that most participants thought of others as similar to themselves).
 Then those choosing office at 9:00 are in a somewhat similar situation
 as those choosing canteen at 8:40.
 When choosing office at 9:00, participants arriving later will generally
 choose office as well, while it's near random for those arriving earlier.
 When choosing canteen at 8:40, something similar applies, since they would
 believe those arriving at 8:30 to choose canteen most of the time, and
 those arriving at 8:500 to choose canteen nearly half the time.
 But while there are 53% (95% confidence intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm4)$
\end_inset

 who are very certain when arriving at 8:40, there are 60% (similar confidence
 intervals) who are very certain of their choice when arriving at 9:00.
 However, the most telling result is likely the descending certainty across
 arrival times.
 To see this, consider Figure 7, a line-chart with both percent going to
 canteen per arrival time, and for those specific participants, the percent
 who were 'very certain'.

Figure 7 shows how many percent went to the canteen at different arrival
 times (blue line) and how many percent of those gave a 'very certain' estimate
 that the other player had done the same (orange line), both shaded error
 bars showing 0.95 confidence intervals.
 Note that times 9:00 and 9:10 were left out, since participants who went
 to the canteen at these times were few and less interesting, and their
 certainty estimates generally low with wide error margins due to low sample
 (see Appendix F for full chart).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blue line shows that people generally went to the canteen at the same
 rate (~ 91%) at times 8:00 to 8:40, before a significant drop to 47.2% at
 time 8:50.
 The orange line also shows a significant drop in certainty from 8:40 to
 8:50, which is unsurprising, since participants likely went less to the
 canteen at 8:50 exactly because they were less certain about what the other
 player would do.
 The orange line has a different trend from the blue however, since there
 is also a significant drop from 8:30 to 8:40 (13.7 percent points), and
 it even drops 5 percentpoints from 8:10 to 8:20 and 8:20 to 8:30.
 In other words, participants seem to be less 'very certain' as their arrival
 time increase, while their willingness to go to the canteen does not change
 until 8:50.
 There is also an outlier at 8:00.
 There are slightly less participants choosing canteen at 8:00 and when
 they do, they're choose 'very certain' slightly less as well.
 A possible explanation for this is heuristic reasoning applied by participants
 due to the thematic narrative of the game.
 That is, given the propensity of office-jobs starting at 8:00, it is possible
 that some participants have been swayed by their real-world preferences
 when arriving at 8:00 to prefer the office over the canteen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Percentwise, participants went to the canteen 47.2% of the time when arriving
 at 8:50 and chose 'very certain' 39.2% of the time they did so.
 It make sense that when participants don't chose the canteen that often
 (less than half the time), it is because they are uncertain if the other
 player arrived at 9:00, in which case that person would choose office (but
 of course they would not be rewarded even if they had chosen canteen in
 that case).
 Given this belief, it makes sense that they often don't chose 'very certain'
 when choosing canteen at 8:50.
 Now consider 8:40, where 89.8% of the participants chose canteen, and 56%
 of those chose 'very certain'.
 Again, the reason for dominantly choosing canteen at 8:40 is likely due
 to the belief that the other person also chose canteen (which would result
 in a win regardless what time the other time the other had gotten).
 Therefore, it makes sense that the percent choosing 'very certan' is significan
tly higher than at 8:50.
 But now consider 8:30, where 91.2% chose canteen (a similar number to 8:40),
 likely due to the same reason as with 8:40, but where 69.7% of those chose
 'very certain'.
 The surprising result here is that while participants were nearly equally
 predisposed to choose canteen at 8:40 as they were at 8:30, they are significan
tly less certain about it.
 The reason for being less certain at 8:40 than at 8:30 is clear in terms
 of ToM.
 Participants who arrive at 8:40, who themselves often choose office at
 8:50, will not be very certain about their colleague making the same choice
 as them, given the possibility that the other player might have arrived
 at 8:50 and behaved like they would.
 But even if participants have this belief, they do not seem to act on it,
 since they still dominantly choose to go to the office at 8:40.
 To re-iterate, participants are less certain about going to the canteen
 at 8:50 than at 8:40 and they act accordingly, going to the canteen less
 at 8:50 than at 8:40.
 Participants are also less certain about going to the canteen at 8:40 than
 at 8:30, but they don't seem to act accordingly.
 While they're significantly less certain about the other player choosing
 canteen when they arrive at 8:40 compared to 8:30, they choose canteen
 just the same.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us focus on the previous sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.6 and more specifically
 Figure 1 and 7.
 Let us start analyzing Figure 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 shows participants generally go to the canteen (~91% of the time)
 before 8:50 and to the office after 8:50, while they go to the canteen
 a little less than half the times (47%) they arrive at 8:50.
 Going to the office at 9:00 or 9:10 does not indicate any ToM and 8:50
 does arguably not indicate any level of ToM either, since the rules state
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you or your colleague arrive at 9:00 am or after, you should go straight
 to your offices.
 When a participant arrives at 8:50, they consider it possible that the
 other played arrived at 8:40 or 9:00.
 If the latter is the case, the rules state that they should go to the office,
 and this is true regardless of the other players decision and therefore
 modeling their mental state is irrelevant.
 This explains why slightly more than 50% go to the office at 8:50.
 The participants choosing the canteen at 8:50 likely assumes that if the
 other person arrives at 8:40, that person would go to the canteen, which
 makes 8:50 a random choice between office and canteen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

There is also a possibility that some thought that choosing canteen at 9:00
 would be a winning move, as long as the other person arrived at 8:50 and
 also chose canteen.
 But even if some participants had an always-canteen strategy, it does not
 explain why those who chose office at 9:00 chose canteen at 8:50, or why
 some of those that chose office at 8:50 chose canteen at 8:40.
 If a participant believed the other person would choose always choose canteen,
 the only possibly winning move would be canteen as well.
 But if a participant would have chosen office at 9:00, it's unlikely that
 the participant would ascribe others an incorrect interpretation of the
 rules.
 Those choosing canteen at 8:50 might have read the first conjunct of the
 sentence: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you arrive before 9:00 am, you have time to go to the canteen, but you
 should only go if your colleague goes to the canteen as well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, thereby choosing to go to the canteen whenever they arrived before 9:00
 am.
 But the amount of people choosing to go to the office at 8:50 is an indication
 of a correct interpretation of the last conjunct of the sentence, i.e.
 only go if your colleague goes to the canteen as well.
 In other words, the significantly larger amount of participants who went
 to the office at 8:50 than at 8:40 indicates that this subgroup 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 understood (i) they should not go to the canteen at 9:00, (ii) they should
 not go to the canteen if their colleague does not and (iii) their colleague's
 arrival time is within 10 minutes of their own.
 It's reasonable to claim that this leads to going to the office (at least
 sometimes) at 8:50, since they know that if they had arrived at 9:00, they
 would have chosen office, they assume the other person would have done
 the same which makes an office choice rational in at least half of the
 cases.

Let us focus on subgroup 
\emph on
G

above.
 Arriving at 8:50 they imagine that their colleague might have arrived at
 9:00, in which case they know they should not choose canteen.
 If such a participant had a Theory of Mind, we might expect that they would
 have gone to the office at least sometimes at 8:40 as well, for the same
 reasons.
 If player

Now observe Figure 7, specifically the orange trace indicating the percent
 of those going to the canteen who were also 'very certain' that their colleague
 had made the same decision.
 To re-iterate the discussion in section 2.2.6, while we see a near flat developme
nt in the percent going to the canteen up to 8:50, we see a drop in the
 estimated certainty at arrival times before that.
 There is a drop of 13.7 percent points of 'very certain' estimates from
 8:40 to 8:50, while there is only a drop of 1.4 percent point for going
 to the canteen from 8:40 to 8:50.
 This indicates that participants who choose canteen at 8:40 are aware that
 the other person might arrive at 8:50 and choose office, but this knowledge
 does not change the decisions for the participants.
 In other words, participants do not consult their theory of mind when asked
 where they would go (they go to the canteen at 8:40 since they know both
 players arrived before 9:00), but do consult their theory of mind when
 asked how certain they are that their participant made the same choice.
 It might be due to having more time to think about the particular situation,
 or because the question is framed in terms of what the other player did,
 which prompts players do model other players mental states.

There is a caveat here.
 Just because someone is less certain about going to the canteen at 8:40
 than at 8:40 does not mean it would be rational for them to choose office,
 since they can still be more certain that canteen is the right answer than
 that office is.
 In fact, a canteen choice at 8:40 might be rational for the following reason.
 Imagine participants who choose office at 8:50 does it at random, i.e.
 they know they might have chosen office in another situation (ignore the
 fact that this would entail giving a 'very uncertain' estimate).
 When those participants arrive at 8:40, they might believe that if their
 colleague arrives 8:30, they would choose canteen, and if they arrive at
 8:50, they would go to the office about half of the times.
 That would mean there would be a 75% chance of the other player going to
 the canteen, which would warrant a canteen choice but with lowered certainty.

But let us look closer at the data.
 Let us expand subgroup 
\emph on
G

so it only includes those who chose office at 8:50, 9:00 and 9:10.
 We might then plausibly assume that these players understood the rules
 stated above, (i) don't go to the office at 9:00 or later (ii) only go
 to the canteen if your colleague does the same and (iii) you always arrive
 within 10 minutes of your colleague.
 We provide similar to Figure 7 below, excluding players who chose canteen
 at 8:50, 9:00 or 9:10.
 This includes 327 participants.

Figure 8.
 shows that even participants who always go to the office at 8:50 repeat
 a similar pattern as found in Figure 8.
 That is, such participants still quite generally go to canteen from 8:00
 to 8:40, while the percent being 'very certain' drops significantly.
 The percent going to the canteen drops 2.4% from 8:00 to 8:40, while the
 amount of participants choosing canteen and giving a 'very certain' estimate
 that the other player did the same drops 18.7% from 8:00 to 8:40.
 It's possible that these participants thought that while they themselves
 would always go to the office at 8:50, they do not trust that others would,
 thereby lowering their certainty estimate.
 It's also possible that players have based their decision on going to the
 canteen whenever they knew they would be rewarded if both players do (ignoring
 ToM considerations), but when asked how certain they were about the other
 player doing the same, they are explicitly asked about what the other player
 would do, not what they themselves would do, which prompts ToM-related
 reasoning to a larger extend than simple decision-related questions.
 To summarize: Participants in the Canteen Dilemma did seemingly not exhibit
 ToM to large extend when given questions in the context of practical decisions,
 but when asked about their certainty about other participants decisions,
 their consulted their ToM to a larger extend.
 Let us now look at a few related results from the literature on Theory
 of Mind (and the lack thereof).

 It is specifically the ability to represent others’ beliefs that is not
 reliably used to interpret others’ behavior.
 Keysar et al.
 do not deny that the belief system of adults includes at ToM and that they
 are able to gain knowledge and reason about the mental states of others,
 but rather that even adults with this capacity do not necessarily draw
 on it, nor do they necessarily consult crucial knowledge about the mental
 states of others, even when it is required for successful interaction.

They argue that traditional tests for the development of ToM in children
 rests on reflective tasks, often meant to tap meta-cognitive abilities
 such as being able to evaluate and reflect on the knowledge of oneself
 and others.
 Keysar et al.
 results imply that there is a disassociation between reflective and spontaneous
 use of ToM.
 Their their test focuses on adult's interpreation of another's linguistic
 behavior in order to test whether this reflective ability is used spontaneously.
 This relates to the canteen Dilemma, since participants are told their
 arrival time before being asked 'where do you go?', which is in itself
 a practical question about a decision, rather than a reflective question
 about the mental states of others.
 The time limit on each round also plausibly adds to the spontaneity of
 the situation.
 They offer possible explanations for their findings:

Why might adults sometimes fail to deploy their fully-developed theory of
 mind? Perhaps in the “real world” perspectives tend to coincide such that
 what is present and salient to one person will tend to be salient to another.
 Under these circumstances, directly computing what another person knows
 or does not know at a given moment might be more trouble than it is worth.
 Furthermore, even when perspectives do not coincide, feedback from one’s
 partner can obviate the need to compute that person’s perspective for successfu
l coordination.
 For example, although participants in our experiments often moved hidden
 objects, the director quickly corrected them and they eventually moved
 the correct object.
 Although participants could have pre-computed the director’s perspective,
 they got away with being egocentric because they could count on the director’s
 feedback.
 In short, the dynamic nature of face-to-face interaction gives people latitude
 to be egocentric by effectively distributing the burden of perspective
 taking across interlocutors.

Their explanation points to the economics of applying ToM.
 If applying ToM is computationally resourceful, it might be more efficient
 to generally ignore one's ToM and accept the cost when errors occur, and
 then start incorporating ToM in that (and similar) situations.
 This is of course problematic in one-shot cases with high stakes.

 The same explanation could be used for the Canteen Dilemma.
 In everyday scenario's it's likely that people even if people do not arrive

possessing a theory of mind is crucial for effective social functioning,
 but this does not mean that people automatically employ this capacity.
 Although it appears that people interpret others’ mental states relatively
 effortlessly, what people do reflexively is use their own mental states.

 I take 'reflexively modeling their own mental state' to mean that they
 imagine other's mental states as their own.
 This could either mean a mental model where you only ascribe beliefs, intention
s and so on to the other person which would be justified from their perspective,
 or it might mean using your own mental state as a model for the other,
 including at least some of your own beliefs, intentions and so on.
 In that case, a participant in the Canteen Dilemma arriving at 8:40, would
 imagine the other player possibly arriving at 8:50, and thinking about
 what they themselves would do at 8:50 
\emph on
assuming they know the other player arrived at 8:40

 This explains a high prevalence of canteen choices at 8:40.

The Curse of Knowledge in Reasoning About False Beliefs

 (2003), namely that adults fail false-belief tests much like younger children
 do if sensitive enough meassures are used.
 More specifically, they show that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

adults’ own knowledge of an event’s outcome can compromise their ability
 to reason about another person’s beliefs about that event.
 We also found that adults’ perception of the plausibility of an event mediates

Their focus was on what they called a

 In other words, when adults have to reason about the mental states of others,
 they are more likely to ascribe knowledge to the other person if they possess
 the knowledge themselves.
 Their second result show that the extend to which adults do this depend
 on how justified they believe their knowledge is.

To see how this relates to the Canteen Dilemma, consider participants who
 arrived at e.g.
 8:40.
 Such a participant know that both players going to the canteen results
 in the biggest reward.
 When, or if, they start making a mental model of the other player and consider
 their reasoning if they arrived at 8:50, the 'curse of knowledge' entails
 that some are bound to ascribe their own knowledge to the other player.
 That is, because the player at 8:40 knows it's safe to go to the canteen,
 they possible ascribe this knowledge to the other player as well.

The Canteen Dilemma shows this since there is a drastic drop from 8:50 to

 Results from the Canteen Dilemma possible shows that even when participants

Applying ToM requires knowledge of its benefits

The studies above show that higher order social reasoning presents a serious
 cognitive challenge for adults.
 Note for example the remark in

Learning to Apply Theory of Mind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Verbrugge & Mol (2008): 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Our results provide a warning against assuming that because some people
 (such as trained logicians) on some occasions apply higher-order Theory
 of Mind, such reasoning is at all widespread
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 That is, some research show that adults rely notable less on higher order
 ToM than researchers might intuitively think.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbrugge (2009) describes possible explanations for this apparent difficulty.
 The first is that there is a high processing cost associated with ToM,
 which causes failure to perform social reasoning on a sufficiently high
 level when the processing demands are high.
 The other Verbrugge describes is that higher order social reasoning does
 not necessarily transfer from one domain of application to the other.
 But the possibly most important reason as to why people fail to apply sufficien
t ToM, is that in order for a person incorporate higher order ToM in their
 decisions, it is not just necessary that they have the capacity for it,
 they must also be aware of the advantage of incorporating such knowledge
 into their decisions and actions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In other words, in order to use ToM, adults must be become aware of its
 benefits, but the it might difficult to notice its benefits without depending
 on ToM in the first place.
 We might therefore expect certain individuals to be proficient in using
 their ToM, not (only) if they have an increased capacity for it, but also
 if they more acutely pick up cues as to when it is required (e.g.
 recognizing patterns of interactions without common knowledge, where people
 are bound to have different beliefs about the same event).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbrugges other point is harder to establish, i.e.
 that ToM might not be a uniform mental ability, but rather constitutes
 a broader family of mental abilities.
 It possibly depends on the extend to which ToM is task dependent, which
 is not well researched.
