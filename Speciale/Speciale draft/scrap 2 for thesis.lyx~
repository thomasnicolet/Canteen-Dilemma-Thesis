 reading print comes in continuously varying degrees.
 Reading minds might too.

] When it comes to the second-order false belief task in Flobbe et al., almost
 all children passed the test.
 When answering the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where does Mary think that John will look for the chocolate?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, correct second-order social reasoning entails answering

.
 Notice that first-order reasoning, attributing 0-order reasoning to Mary
 and assuming that Mary does not consider John's beliefs, entails answering
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the toy chest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (that is where Mary believes the chocolate to be).
 But according to 0-order social reasoning, that is, not distinguishing
 between beliefs of others and one's own, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the toy chest
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is the correct answer as well.
 If these different orders of reasoning entailed different answers, it might
 be considerably more difficult, since it would require participants to
 realize not just that their 0-order reasoning is incorrect but also their
 first-order reasoning.
 In other words, if a participant believes that the experiment is structured
 such that the answer entailed by 0-order reasoning (which they are capable
 of) is 'wrong' in some sense, which they would be right to infer in this
 case, it might dissuade them from giving this answer, without relying on
 second-order reasoning.

The canteen dilemma is structured very similarly to the consecutive numbers
 example.
 Whenever we are faced with experimental facts concerning the differences
 between proscriptions from epistemic logic and how people actually think,
 we might be inclined to conclude that such results only show

 and seminal studies like

 This is partly true, since the validity of established logical systems
 does not change if someone makes different inferences.
 But when it comes to having a Theory of Mind and reasoning about the mental
 states of others, the salient feature must be the accuracy of such a representa
tion, not how well it depicts what their mental model or reasoning ought
 to look like.
 If we want to interact intelligently with ambient technologies like self-drivin
g cars and rescue-robots, they will also have to be able to reason about
 what humans think and as such they should be aware of the human cognitive
 limits when it comes to higher order social reasoning

 Non-human agents making erroneous assumptions about how people actually
 reason and basing their decisions on such assumptions is bound to lead
 to sub-optimal cooperation.
 That means that even if we stick to the traditional normative program of
 logic, when it comes to higher order social reasoning, the way that human
 or non-human agents

reason.
 To rephrase Frege, sometimes people have to consider how people actually
 think, and not just how they ought to think, if they are not to miss the
 truth.
 This leads to looking into the insights about real higher order social
 reasoning gathered from behavioral experiments in cognitive science.
