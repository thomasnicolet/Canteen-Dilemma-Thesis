\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often have to attribute mental states to others in order to successfully
 predict and understand their behavior.
 This cognitive capacity plays an integral role in social interaction and
 is therefore a fundamental mechanic of social dynamics.
 The cognitive capacity in question has traditionally been referred to as
 'theory of mind' and has seen immense scientific attention since Premack
 & Woodruff 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Premack chimp ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 asked the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in their seminal paper of 1978.
 The canteen dilemma is a game aimed at testing how this cognitive capacity
 is drawn upon in coordination problems.
 The canteen dilemma is a two player coordination game with imperfect informatio
n devised and implemented as part of a research project at the Center for
 Information and Bubble Studies in collaboration with Robin Engelhardt and
 Thomas Bolander.
 The structure of the game emphasize reasoning about the possible beliefs
 of others, including their reasoning about one's own and so on.
 The term 'theory of mind' most often refers to the ability to represent
 mental states of others such as beliefs or intentions but has been used
 in various different research settings since its inception.
 The term has also been used somewhat interchangeably with 'mentalizing'

 The heterogeneity of the research studying this cognitive capacity has
 researchers like Schaafsma et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 to call for a reformulation of theory of mind.
 Since terminological debates are outside the scope of this article, the
 various terms are viewed synonomously.
 Because this article is focused on making decisions depending on reasoning
 about the possible mental states of others, the favored terms will be higher-or
der social reasoning or cognition or even higher-order reasoning.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper attempts to focus on the nuanced complexities within social cognition.
 It specifically argues for a more nuanced picture of cognitive diversity
 than traditional descriptions allow, which often state that some demographic
 have a capacity to reason up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 order of social reasoning but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 The possible lack of introspection into sociocognitive limits is also discussed
 as part of sociocognitive limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canteen dilemma experiment involved two players, each assigned an arrival
 time between 8:00 am and 9:10 am told their time is always 10 minutes apart.
 Participants then had to make matching decisions between the office and
 the canteen, while told that they have to go to the office if either arrive
 at 9:00 or later.
 Their decisions therefore involve considering the possible arrival time
 of the other player and possibly their considerations about the arrival
 times and so on.
 Our findings suggest that participants exhibited social reasoning in details
 which might not be encapsulated by 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-orders of social reasoning.
 Our results also indicate a lack an introspection into limits of social
 reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conceptual clarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some conceptual remarks are necessary due to research on social reasoning
 possibly being unclear in terminology (see also Section 1 of the accompanying
 introduction).
 Schaafsma et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schaafsma deconstructing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have presented some healthy skepticism concerning studies on social cognition.
 Schaafsma et al.
 argue that the term 'theory of mind' has been used vaguely and inconsistently
 The authors call for a deconstruction of theory of mind into a comprehensive
 set of basic components, after which a scientifically tractable concept
 can be reconstructed.
 While such a project is outside the scope of this thesis, it is important
 to note that the current scientific picture of the mental capacity associated
 with theory of mind might be incomplete or lacking in precise terminology.
 Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 also mentions that it is possible that theory of mind is not a uniform
 mental ability, but that different applications of social cognition constitutes
 distinct cognitive abilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues raised by Schaafsma et al.
 suggests that social cognition could be made up of a plethora of cognitive
 processes.
 This is already indicated by some of the debates within the field.
 Take for example discussion about 
\emph on
nativism
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
constructivism
\emph default
 regarding social cognition
\emph on
, 
\emph default
arguing whether the capacity to represent the mental states of others is
 an innate genetically inherited capacity, or whether it is a socially developed
 and culturally inherited ability.
 This distinction is mirrored in discussion concerning differences in implicit/e
xplicit and spontaneous/reflective applications of social reasoning.
 
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heyes & Frith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes cultural evolution"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has argued that theory of mind is made up of implicit and explicit social
 reasoning.
 The implicit social cognition is a genetically inherited predisposition
 produced by natural selection, while the other is explicit representation
 of the mental states of others, much like print reading, a culturally inherited
 skill.
 Print reading does depend on cognitive predispositions but these were not
 developed for this purpose.
 Heyes & Frith argue that the implicit system develop early and works in
 a fast and efficient way, whereas the explicit system is slower, developed
 later and cognitively more demanding.
 For these reasons, referring to the cognitive capacity in question as 'social
 reasoning' might implicitly assume some explicit or active component.
 But given that the capacity often referred to as theory of mind consists
 of possibly distinct cognitive abilities, it is difficult to map a definite
 terminology onto it if the cognitive diversity is not well understood.
 None-the-less, there is no doubt that humans are able to understand and
 appreciate that others have minds of their own.
 Exactly how this process is constituted is still being investigated and
 it is the aim of the present thesis to help illuminate some of the intricate
 details of this ability which might also support development of a more
 rigid terminology.

\begin_layout Subsection
Development and limitations of higher order social reasoning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capacity for social reasoning develops through early childhood and is
 essential for recognizing that others have minds of their own with distinct
 desires, intentions and beliefs.
 As such, this capacity allows us to both interpret the behavior of others
 in terms of mental traits, but also to reason and predict how our behavior
 might affect their mental states.
 Mental states are broadly understood as intentions, desires, beliefs or
 emotions, even though the paradigmatic mental state most research focuses
 on is belief.
 Acknowledging that other organisms are sentient like ourselves is essential
 for distinguishing between them and physical constructs.
 So the cognitive capacity to represent the mental states of others have
 possible moral implications, which will be discussed later in section

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the literature on social cognition have been on the developmental
 aspect and limitations in relation to having a higher-order theory of mind.
 Children are often thought to acquire a first-order theory of mind between
 ages 3 to 5 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wimmer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and a capacity for second-order at ages 6 to 8 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Perner"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, some argue that this capacity is present even earlier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chandler,Leslie"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and some argue that basic theory of mind aspects as goal perception are
 present already in 9 to 12-month-old infants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Csibra"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As discussed earlier, it is important to notice that such studies mostly
 refer to implicit mental representation which happens automatically or
 with relative ease.
 In other words, what seems like higher-order social reasoning might not
 involve a deliberative reasoning process.
 This complicates the view of social cognition somewhat, since it makes
 it harder to determine whether the behavior in question is actually due
 to modeling the mental states of others or due to learned behavior which
 arguably does not require the capacity to do so.
 It is also possible that such a demarcation is difficult to entertain at
 all.

Adults are usually limited at second-order social reasoning at most while
 there is evidence of third and fourth-order reasoning when playing games
 against computational theory of mind agents 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "veltman training use of theory of mind,Verbrugge 2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 There is evidence that social reasoning is not just limited in the sense
 of being restricted to second-order reasoning but also that any application
 of social reasoning is severely limited when it comes to deliberate and
 spontaneous use.
 See for example Lin et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lin et al reflexively mindblind"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for evidence that when interpreting the actions of others, the default
 is to rely on one's own mental state as representative of the mental states
 of others.
 This tendency have notable been reserved to children with autism disorder
 in a notable paper by Cohen, Leslie & Frith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "baron autistic have theory of mind"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Frith & Happe 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Frith autism"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have subsequently argued that autism disorders cannot be characterized
 by theory of mind deficits and instead posit underlying cognitive impairments
 as explanatory forces.
 This shows both that deficits in theory of mind are not directly related
 to cognitive disorders, as well as how research on social cognition can
 affect our understanding of what normal cognitive development amounts to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lin et al.
 also argue that applying higher-order social reasoning requires effortful
 attention, meaning it is limited under cognitive load.
 Birch & Bloom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bloom"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find evidence of what they call a 
\emph on
curse of knowledge
\emph default
 bias which refers to how adults' own knowledge about an event can make
 them worse at correctly attributing false beliefs about that event to others.
 Keysar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show a disassociation between adult's ability to correctly attribute false
 beliefs to others and actually putting this ability to use when interpreting
 the instructions of others.
 Such studies indicate that there is a possible distinction between social
 reasoning applied in reflective settings and its use in guiding decisions
 in practice.
 As mentioned above, Heyes & Frith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes cultural evolution"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue it is possible that the fast, implicit social reasoning is a naturally
 developed cognitive ability, while the slower reflective use is culturally
 developed.
 The authors make the analogy between reading print and 'reading minds'.
 Following the analogy, it is possibly that profeciency in mind-reading,
 much like print-reading, is a lot more nuanced than just being literate
 or not.
 This leads us to the next section which argue that such diversity in proficienc
y might have been underappreciated in the literature.

Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"

\end_inset

 describes social cognition such that zero-order theory of mind concern
 'world facts' while 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order theory of mind models 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-order theory of mind of others.
 This is the commonly accepted view of higher-order theory of mind which
 I adhere to.
 But it involves a possible pitfall which Verbrugge calls a risky idealization,
 namely positing a fixed discontinuous bound on social cognition, or in
 other words, assuming each person can reason up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order of social cognition but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 This assumes that sociocognitive diversity is exhaustively described by
 categories of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order theory of mind for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

.
 While possibly not intended, most studies seem to imply this.
 Such cases includes studies which show that subjects pass a first-order
 false belief task but not a second-order task.
 Such studies implicitly assumes that all those who are capable of 
\emph on
n
\emph default
-order reasoning but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 are cognitively on par at least in terms of social cognition.
 Much like capacity to read print comes in very nuanced degrees, I argue
 that capacities for higher-order social reasoning can be nuanced as well
 and in finer details than just 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 orders of reasoning.

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional false belief task is intended to test for the 
\emph on
presence
\emph default
 of a belief and not its degree, but that does not mean that such a belief
 cannot be held in degrees.
 This is also an epistemological point (see for example Bayesian epistemology
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bayesian epistemology"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We can describe beliefs in terms of assigning probabilities to something
 being true or false.
 Assigning probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to some event being true is equivalent to assigning 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

 probability to the event being false.
 Now put this into perspective of a second-order false belief task like
 the one employed by Flobbe et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It involves the following chocolate bar story: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John and Mary are in the living room when their mother returns home with
 a chocolate bar that she bought.
 Mother gives the chocolate to John, who puts it into the drawer.
 After John has left the room, Mary hides the chocolate in the toy chest.
 But John accidentally sees Mary putting the chocolate into the toy chest.
 Crucially, Mary does not see John.
 When John returns to the living room, he wants to get his chocolate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Participants are given the first-order false belief question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does John know that Mary has hidden the chocolate in the toy chest?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the second-order false belief question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where does Mary think that John will look for the chocolate?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 among other linguistic control questions.
 Those answering the first question correctly (John knows Mary placed the
 chocolate in the toy chest) but not the second one (that Mary thinks John
 will look for the chocolate in the drawer), will be said to have the capacity
 for first-order social reasoning but not second-order.
 Now assume that everyone in a group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
passed the first test but answered incorrectly in the second.
 But suppose that some in 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 actually assigned a positive probability, for example 20%, to the correct
 answer being true.
 I argue that while this is not enough to warrant them answering it, it
 is indicative of more social reasoning than not considering the answer
 plausible at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible objection could be that you can either consider someone's mental
 state or not, because if even consider the correct answer as possibly being
 true, it must be due to attributing a mental state state to someone else.
 But this is inconsistent with saying that agents in 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
does not have a second-order theory of mind, which is what traditionally
 argued.
 I also accept that those failing the second-order test might not have a
 second-order theory of mind, but those assigning 20% to correct answer
 are closer to it than those assigning 0%.
 Humans might not explicitly view their beliefs as probabilities, but the
 current argument only requires that people can believe something to be
 true in non-binary degrees.
 It might also be argued that my argument is committed to the existence
 of 1.5-order social reasoning which is not well-defined.
 In response to this I argue that the terminology of theory of mind have
 already seen significant criticism, for example in terms of implicitly
 treating theory of mind as a monolithic capacity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schaafsma deconstructing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, so my point might just be another case of how theory of mind terminology
 is not up to date to the empirical reality.

\begin_layout Standard
To rephrase, describing orders of social reasoning only in integers such
 as first-order or second-order reasoning might be an approximation which
 does not provide the full picture of the socio-cognitive processes involved.
 Our findings in the canteen dilemma does suggest variation within those
 exhibiting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 order theory of mind such that some are closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 than others.
 It indicates that (higher orders of) social cognition can be expressed
 in terms which are more continuous than simply 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-orders of theory of mind.
 This leads to the canteen dilemma experiment below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The canteen dilemma experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canteen dilemma is a two-player coordination game with imperfect information.
 The game is structurally similar to the consecutive number example in Ditmarsch
 & Kooi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "consecutive numbers book"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It is framed in a thematic story as to make some of the zero-order logical
 reasoning easier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meijering,wason 1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The story is the following.
 Each player is told that they and their colleague arrive for work every
 morning between 8:00 am and 9:10 am.
 They always arrive 10 minutes apart but only know their own arrival time.
 The payoff structure is ordered such that 
\begin_inset Formula $(1>2>3)$
\end_inset

 where (1) is going to the canteen together if both arrive before 9:00 am,
 (2) is going to the office together at any time and (3) being all other
 configurations, that is, discoordination or either player going to the
 canteen at 9:00 or later.
 The game consists of a numbers of rounds where each player are given their
 own arrival time and have to decide between going to the canteen and the
 office.
 The game consisted of 10 rounds in the AMT trial and 30 rounds in the DTU
 trials.
 The game has the unintuitive structure such that there is no strategy which
 can guarantee canteen coordination.
 The Nash Equilibrium is therefore both players always playing office with
 maximal certainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The structure of the game involves reasoning about and predicting the actions
 of the other player and is as such facilitated by higher-order social reasoning.
 While canteen coordination has the highest payoff whenever both players
 arrive before 9:00, which is possibly true when arriving at 8:50, going
 to the canteen at 8:50 still involves the risk of the other player arriving
 at 9:00.
 I therefore stipulate that zero-order is sufficient for making an office
 choice at 8:50 since it requires players to reason about the possible arrival
 time of the other player which is a non-mental fact.
 I postulate the following: (1) participants choosing office 8:40 and earlier
 depend on first-order reasoning at 8:40, second-order at 8:30 and so on
 and (2) participants using only zero-order reasoning choose canteen at
 8:40 and earlier, office at 9:00 and later while 8:50 is possibly chosen
 randomly.
 It is of course possible that a player who applies 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning while not believing that the other is capable of
 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

-order reasoning therefore chooses canteen regardless.
 That is, without common knowledge about rationality, even rational players
 would not be expected to play the rational strategy of only choosing office.
 So canteen choices at 8:40 and earlier do not necessarily imply a lack
 of social reasoning, even though a lack of social reasoning entails canteen
 choices at these times.

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment included 192 adults on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform.
 Another treatment performed on AMT is excluded because participants had
 an insufficient amount of time to read the instructions.
 Certain settings were applied in order to only include participants from

 Intelligence Tasks (HIT's) and a HIT approval rating of at least 98%.
 Participants were also given a unique ID such that they could only enter
 the experiment once and were awarded a $2 participation fee if they completed
 the HIT.
 We also conducted the experiment twice at the Technical University of Denmark
 (DTU) with 106 and 50 participants each during coursework.
 The courses in question were on artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems
 and logic, so the participants in the DTU experiments were likely primed
 for the experiment, especially the first of those trials.
 The second trial exceeded the duration of the allocated lecture, meaning
 some were eager to end the experiment.

After accepting our HIT and providing informed consent, participants were
 put in a 'waiting room' until they were paired up with another participant.
 After a group was formed, participants were directed to an initial introduction
 page which detailed the rules of the game with a time limit of 240 seconds
 (see Appendix A for screenshot).
 After reading the instructions, participants were directed to round 1 (of
 10) where they were given their own arrival time and asked to make a decision
 between between going to the canteen or the office.
 Each round had a time limit of 61 seconds and also included the rules from
 the introduction.
 After making this decision they were prompted to estimate how certain they
 were that the other player made the same choice as them, ranging from very
 uncertain, slightly certain, somewhat certain, quite certain to very certain.
 After both players made their choices, they were prompted to a results
 page showing them the results of the previous rounds, including arrival
 times for both players, their choices, their own certainty estimate and
 resulting payoff.

Players payoff were implemented using logarithmic scoring as a proper scoring
 rule.
 Players were initially assigned a bonus of $10 for the AMT trial, which
 was reduced by a penalty each round depending on well they did and their
 certainty estimate of success.
 AMT participants were paid their final bonus plus their participation fee
 while DTU students were told to maximize their payoff and awarded some
 playing cards for doing well.

Figure 1 shows that participants generally went to the canteen from 8:00
 to 8:40 and to the office at 9:00 at 9:10, while office was favored at
 8:50.
 The orange line shows that even if participants went more or less to the
 canteen with the same propensity from 8:00 to 8:40, the percent who are
 very certain about it seems to start dropping already from 8:10 or 8:20.
 It was postulated above that going to the office does not necessarily rely
 on higher-order social reasoning, while office at 8:40 requires first-order
 social reasoning, 8:30 second-order and so on.
 While the general canteen choices at 8:00 to 8:40 do not necessitate a
 theory of mind, the different certainty estimates do.
 Ascribing 
\emph on
p 
\emph default
probability to canteen being the right choice is equivalent to ascribing
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

 probability to the office.
 So those who are less than maximally certain about canteen seem to consider
 office as a possibility, and I argue that some appropriate order of social
 reasoning is necessary to have this belief.
 The orange line shows that from 8:20 to 8:40, the percent being very certain
 about canteen choice drops from 72% to 44%, while the percent choosing
 canteen only drops from 93% to 87%.
 This result indicates that the certainty estimate given by participants
 indicated some theory of mind which was not shown as robustly in the binary
 canteen/office choices.
 It more specifically show that there is significant uncertainty about canteen
 choices at 8:30 and 8:40.

Figure 2 shows that a majority of participants (75%) chose 8:30 to 8:50
 as the point in time which would be safe if they could have agreed upon
 it with their colleague before the game.
 The rest are somewhat evenly scattered among other answer possibilities,
 possibly due to random choices.
 The pragmatic nature of the question implies that answering for example
 8:30 implies that all arrival times before that would be safe while those
 after would not be.
 If participants simply agree to go to the canteen at 8:50, then it would
 be safe to go to the canteen at 8:40.
 The pragmatic aspect of the question arguably imply a specific answer implies
 that they would not go to the canteen at later times.
 Notice that the answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Figure 3 shows that participants were least likely to answer that it was
 their own fault that the game had ended (25%) and most likely to answer
 that it was the other's fault (41%).
 This is a complicated question of course, since the nature of the game
 makes it difficult to say in most cases that either player made a wrong
 decision.
 The third category (other reason) is supposed to be a catch-all for other
 explanations.
 There are a few explanations for why participants might have blamed the
 other player over themselves.
 The first possible explanation is that even those aware of their mistakes
 might not want to admit it (even to themselves).
 A second and more interesting explanation is that those who engage in for
 example first-order social reasoning only attributes zero-order reasoning
 to others.
 When discoordination happens, this naturally leads to blaming the other
 player, since participants did not predict and nor can they understand
 the order of theory of mind used by the other player.

 Half of the participants were given 8:40 as their own arrival time while
 the other half were given 9:00.
 The question concerns whether player's own knowledge of the other's arrival
 time affect their prediction of the other player's decision.
 It relates to the curse of knowledge from Birch & Bloom

As figure 5 shows, participants who arrive at 9:00 are significantly more
 inclined to answer that the other player will go to the office than those
 arriving at 8:40.
 The confidence intervals are overlapping however and later results at at
 second DTU trial had differing results (see Appendix C).
 However the data from the first DTU trial overall indicated the participants
 utilized higher-order social reasoning more than both of the other trials.
 That is, the first DTU trial had results which implied that participants
 had both understood the rules of the games better and had higher-order
 theory of mind considerations, but none the less, the curse of knowledge
 was most prevalent in that case.
 The first DTU trial also included slightly more than twice the participants
 than in the second.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Categorizing free text answers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants were asked about what strategy they had used and there seemed
 to be some patterns in these answers.
 Some answer 'common sense' or 'intuition', while some simply stated that
 the earlier the arrival time, the more they went to the canteen, without
 further specification.
 A few answers were explicitly referring to first or second-order theory
 of mind considerations.
 Some answers were also indicative of forward inductive reasoning or reactive
 strategies, that is, decisions depending on the previous actions of the
 other player.
 Many of these answers indicate a belief that if some strategy, like the
 reactive strategy, was just deployed correctly by both players, it would
 lead to coordination with certainty (implying that once you know what the
 other player does at specific times, you can coordinate) However, regardless
 of knowing the other players strategy, if that strategy contains a canteen
 choice, coordination is not certain across the whole game.
 This also includes players who employed first or second-order social reasoning,
 who were sure that if only the other player had done the same, their earlier
 canteen choices had been safe.
 See for example the following strategy answer from the first DTU trial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was easy for 8:00, 8:10 and 8:20.
 There I would go to the canteen based on the fact, that my friend would
 arrive at latest at 8:30, and then they would in worst case scenario think
 that I arrived at 8:40.
 Thus we would both go for coffee.
 In the case of 8:30, I would also go to the canteen, but I would not be
 very certain cause my friend might be there at 8:40 and think that I would
 be there at 8:50.
 They might think that IF I am there at 8:50, I would think that my friend
 is there at 9:00, and thus I might go to the office.
 Thus for 8:30 and above it is not certain.
 It would depend on the history of our decisions...
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it explicitly refers to the participants using their second-order
 social reasoning, it indicates a lack of third-order social reasoning in
 relation to times 8:20 and earlier.
 There is no uncertainty about these arrival times, implying an awareness
 of the possible importance of third-order reasoning.
 This is important because it does not just show that people have different
 cognitive capacities which can lead to mistakes in games.
 It also indicates that people do not have sufficient introspection to predict
 the possibility of such mistakes.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few problematic aspects of Figure 1.
 Notice that there are 10% going to the canteen at 9:00 and 9:10.
 There are also 40% choosing canteen at 8:50, even though the rules state
 that if one or the other player arrives at 9:00, they should go straight
 to the office.
 There are also around 10% going to the office at times 8:00 and 8:10 and
 we do not expect participants to have a sufficiently higher-order theory
 of mind to make such choices informed.
 There are bound to be some random answers in such tests which accounts
 for at least some of the answers given.
 We might consider if all the canteen choices at 9:00 were due to random
 choices or if the rules were ambiguously stated such that these decisions
 were made deliberately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a few of the free text strategy answers, it is possible that some
 participants were biased towards the canteens for reasons not stated in
 the rules.
 In other words, their real world preference for coffee in the canteen over
 work in the office might have persuaded them to choose the canteen as much
 as possible.
 This means that the positive facilitative effect of providing a thematic
 narrative to a logical reasoning test 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meijering,wason 1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 might not have been effective.
 Everyday narratives can help at explaining abstract structures, but it
 might do so by prompting heuristics which might sometimes be helpful and
 sometimes detrimental to logical reasoning.
 However if the rules were too ambiguous, we would expect the same results
 in the DTU trials.
 See the plot below for the first DTU trial which depicts the same as figure
 1, percent choosing canteen and percent being very certain about their
 canteen choice.

Students in the first DTU trial made nearly exclusively canteen choces from
 8:00 to 8:30 and nearly exclusively office choices at 9:00 and 9:10.
 A plausible explanation for the difference in results is that the DTU students
 were more motivated to participate and understood the rules better and
 as such made less random choices.
 Therefore, a significant amount of the noise in the AMT results are likely
 due to random decisions.
 In the DTU trial depicted in Figure 6, we might still consider 43% a high
 amount of participants choosing the canteen at 8:50.
 This was possibly due to the wording of the instructions.
 It was changed from

, emphasizing that both players have to arrive before 9:00 am to warrant
 a canteen choice.
 See Appendix D for a plot similar to Figure 4 for the second DTU trial.
 Contrary to expectations, this lead to a significant increase of canteen
 choices at 8:50, as 63% chose canteen at 8:50 in the second DTU trial.
 This implies that it was at least not just the wording which lead to the
 behavior in question.
 Notice that the orange line shows the amount of people being very certain
 about their canteen choice.
 This means that every other choice was either office or less than maximally
 certain canteen choice.
 I have argued in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Continuous-higher-order-social"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that such answers are evidence of higher-order social reasoning, so the
 plot above shows 97% applying zero-order reasoning at 8:50, 58% applying
 some first-order reasoning at 8:40 and 20% applying some second-order reasoning
 at 8:30.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Continuity in orders of social reasoning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have proposed that office choices at 8:40 and 8:30 are indicative of first
 and second-order social reasoning.
 Figure 1 and 4 shows that while participantss might have chosen canteen
 at most arrival times leading up to 8:50, they are less certain at later
 arrival times.
 The reason for not being certain about your canteen choice is considering
 that the other might have chosen office and the reason for believing that
 at 8:40 and earlier is a result of higher-order social cognition.
 See Figure 7 below for all certainty estimates.

The certainty estimates of success given by the participants are important.
 The certainty estimates allowed for non-binary answers meaning participants
 could qualify their belief.
 We can also note that going to the canteen and ascribing 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
probability to the other player doing the same is equivalent to ascribing
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

 probability to the other player choosing the office.
 Therefore, if this certainty estimate can be indicative of a higher order
 social reasoning, it is possible that higher order social cognition in
 general can be understood in degrees in between orders of social reasoning
 measured in integers.
 This deflects what Verbrugge calls the simplistic danger of positing fixed
 bounds on social cognition, such as 'everyone can reason up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 order of theory of mind, but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 It is possible that few actually believe that higher-order social cognition
 only exists in discrete degrees such that there is a sudden jump from first
 to second-order social reasoning and no middle ground.
 None the less, this is the picture often given in research on social cognition.
 This result arguably calls for a nuanced picture of the mental capacity
 related to representing the mental states of others which does not presume
 that it is an all or nothing capacity.

Lack of introspection

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

The certainty estimates in Figure 1 and 4 indicate that participants were
 very certain about going to the canteen at sufficiently early times.
 Due to the lack of uncertainty involved, these answers also seemed easier
 for participants than later arrival times as indicated in free text answers.
 See for example the following answer: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If it was close to 9:00AM, within 20 minutes or so, I would go to the office.
 Otherwise I would just chose to go to the canteen.
 Unfortunately it almost worked out for everyone except one, and I have
 no idea why they would have chosen to go to the office on said round because
 it was really early and we would have had plenty of time to go to the canteen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This answer implies that the participant chose canteen at 8:30 and earlier
 and office at 8:40 and later.
 Notice that not only does the reasoning stop at 8:30, the reasoning behind
 going to the office at 8:50 and 8:40 is not continued for earlier arrival
 times, even though both 8:40 and 8:50 include the possibility of canteen-coordi
nation as well.
 The participant's co-player answered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 and while grammatical unconventional, it likely refer to the mind of the
 other player, indicating that the importance of inferring the mental states

This means that because participants were unable to infer that they might
 have to choose office, they do not consider it a viable strategy.
 If simply arriving early enough, players seemed apt at believing that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

there is plenty of time to go to the canteen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The statement is true in a zero-order sense, since both players could go
 to the canteen whenever one arrives at 8:40 or earlier.
 But the task of the canteen dilemma is not just to discern whether or not
 this is the case, it is also to think about if the other player knows this,
 if the other player knows you know it and so on.
 The participant choosing to go to the office at 8:40 means that even though
 the participant knew it was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

early enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 this.

The importance of this is not just that higher orders of social reasoning
 were lacking, but also that participants did not have introspection in
 regards to this.
 The lack of introspection shown in the canteen dilemma entails that when
 participants arrive sufficiently early and are certain that the other player
 will go to the canteen, they often do not understand the other player and
 think they made a mistake.

This indicates that higher-orders of social cognition are not just epistemically
 unavailable to participants, they are implicitly regarded as irrelevant.
 We can infer this from the situations where such reasoning is required
 but also considered easy or obvious.
 This makes sense for two reasons.
 First, recognizing the relevance of higher orders of social reasoning requires
 consideration of these exact orders of social reasoning.
 Secondly, the seeming irrelevance of higher orders of social reasoning
 is reinforced by behavioral consequences of limited reasoning.
 Participants went to the office at 8:50 roughly half the times, while some
 went to the office at 8:40, but at 8:30 participants generally chose the
 canteen (although some were not 'very certain', likely due to second-order
 social reasoning).
 Of course participants could not have explicitly predicted this, but the
 general pattern of reasoning did indeed make 8:20 out to be a generally
 'safe' canteen choice.
 This is sometimes referred to as a 'meta' within a game with multiple nash-equi
libria, where one of them is adhered to through convention.

This is an interesting aspect of the problem of coordination without common
 knowledge.
 There is a risk of discoordination involved in any strategy involving canteen,
 no matter where the cut-off between canteen and office is put.
 However, if players uniformly choose to go to the canteen at 8:30 and office
 at 8:40 and later, this will only lead to discoordination at 8:30/8:40,
 while all other arrival times will be safe choices.
 It also explains that if both players accept they have to have a cut-off
 point between the canteen and the office, the optimal strategy would be
 setting the cut-off point as late as possible (that is, canteen choices
 at all arrival times before 9:00), since this maximizes canteen coordination
 relative to office coordination.
 But this strategy requires accepting the risk of possible 8:50/9:00 discoordina
tion, which can be inferred from zero-order reasoning.
 So, if one does not accept that risk, that is, one chooses the office at
 8:50, the only explanation for starting to choose canteen at earlier arrival
 times is due to either (1) lack of sufficient order of social reasoning
 or (2) disbelief in whether the ability to perform sufficient order of
 social reasoning is common knowledge.

To summarize, the canteen dilemma indicated both that higher-order social
 reasoning can be continuous and that the participants lack introspection
 about the limitations of their social reasoning.
 The next section is an attempt to put the results and discussion into a
 practical context.
 I do this by going through a case structured similarly to the canteen dilemma
 but where we intuitively do not accept a risk of discoordination.

Higher-order social reasoning seem to present a sometimes insurmountable
 cognitive challenge.
 It is plausible that the complexity of this reasoning also bars off introspecti
on into one's own limitation in regards to this cognitive capacity which
 makes the practical importance of such reasoning easy to ignore.
 This section aims at presenting a case where higher-order reasoning makes
 a practical and moral difference, showing that people cannot rely on their
 intuitions about higher-order social cognition.
 It is in other words intended to show that higher-order social reasoning
 is not simply intellectual gymnastics but makes a tangible moral difference.
 Numerous research papers on social cognition preface their work with homage
 to the quintessential role it plays in social interaction,

.
 Due to the centrality of the capacity in human life, the unreliable and
 limited use of it can have adverse consequences, but due to lack of introspecti
on, we might not be able to properly predict or understand these consequences
 when they occur.

I will show this by going through an example with a structure similar to
 the canteen dilemma.
 The canteen dilemma can be abstracted as a situation where two people simultane
ously have to coordinate on one of two decisions where they both prefer
 one coordinated decision in some situations (like canteen coordination)
 while such a decision is ruled out in others (like arriving at 9:00).
 The example will consists of a situation of two people with the possibility
 of establishing a sexual relation, depending on their mental states (either
 interested or not) and simultaneous choices (taking some action or defecting
 from doing so).
 Mental states and choices are mapped analogously to the canteen dilemma.
 The people in question have to decide whether they want to pursue a relation
 with the other (analogous to canteen) or defect, showing no interest (analogous
 to the office).
 Much like the canteen dilemma, there are some situations where both people
 in the example prefer pursuing a relation with the other, which is when
 both have the right mental state, which is some type of interest in each
 other.
 However, analogous to the canteen dilemma, there are situations where this
 is not possible, which is when at least one person is not interested in
 the other.
 So, whenever both persons are interested in each other, they both prefer
 pursuing some relation, but if either at least one is not interested, or
 if the other defects, none of them are interested in pursuing a relation
 to each other.
 I propose a situation where the act of pursuing a sexual relation with
 a person who is not interested is a violation of that person's boundaries.
 Due to deontological constraints, I assume that such a violation is impermissib
le.
 This is different form the canteen dilemma, where the risk of discoordination
 involved in choosing canteen at 8:50 can be outweighed by possible coordination.
 In the present example, the risk of discoordination is impermissible and
 as such cannot be outweighed by other possible consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only this, I assume much like the canteen dilemma that if one person
 defects (no matter their mental state), it is in the interest of both to
 defect.
 This can be argued for as an plausible assumption in different ways, but
 let us just assume that it is highly unpreferable even if both are interested
 due to social embarrassment involved.
 In other words, canteen/office choice is here made into taking some action
 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset


\emph on
 
\emph default
or refraining from it.
 Now for the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
(Anne) and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
(Bill) are in a social situation structured like above.
 Both Anne and Bill can either be interested in pursuing this relation or
 be disinterested (an internal mental state, call it 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 being interested, which is either true or false relative to a person).
 Both have to simultaneously choose to perform some action (colloquially
 'making a move') in an attempt to pursue this relation or defect and turn
 their back to it (call this 
\begin_inset Formula $!P_{i}$
\end_inset

 indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 does 
\emph on
!P
\emph default
, whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot!P_{i}$
\end_inset

 refers to not doing 
\emph on
!P
\emph default
).
 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 simply refers to an action which in non-reciprocated would be morally problemat
ic, which include speech acts.
 Assume that if a person is disinterested in this relation, they will always
 defect, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot m_{i}\rightarrow\lnot!P_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 As mentioned, if a person defects for whatever reason, it is in the interest
 of both that the other also defects.
 This depends on the assumption that the people in question have good intentions.
 If an action might violate the rights of another, it is in the interest
 of the person to not undertake that action.
 It is also easier to abstract a rights violation as a discoordination if
 it only involves good intentions.
 The following case therefore shows that well-intentioned people can partake
 in actions which has a chance of being morally impermissible, even if they
 want to avoid this, due to limitations of higher-order social cognition.
 Let us not start updating the situation.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the default situation is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

 where there is common knowledge that both Anne and Bill are not interested
 in pursuing any relation to each other and will therefore defect when having
 to make a simultaneous choice about pursuing a sexual relation with each
 other.
 Note that anyone choosing to pursue a relation generates common knowledge
 that they are interested, which is the converse of the implication stated
 above, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $!P_{i}\rightarrow m_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

 both Anne and Bill will defect and we can state the counterfactual that
 if one of them did not defect, they would be morally blameworthy since
 they both know the other is not interested.
 The focus of the next few paragraphs is to keep track of what Bill will
 do and to consider the moral implications involved.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now start updating the situation, imagining 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

 changing over time.
 Let us update the default situation to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

, where Bill tells Anne that he is interested in her (
\begin_inset Formula $m_{b}$
\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is strictly speaking a public announcement in the sense that is public
 to Anne and Bill, but it could still consist of Bill just writing it down
 in front of Anne with no one else around.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It then becomes common knowledge that Bill is interested in Anne, while
 it remains common knowledge that Anne is not interested in him (
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot m_{a}$
\end_inset

).
 When having to make a choice, Anne will defect (she is not interested)
 and so will Bill because he assumes Anne is not interested per default.
 Bill knows that he should not pursue a sexual relation with Anne if she
 is not interested (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}\lnot m_{a}$
\end_inset

), since this would be a violation of her rights and he would be rightfully
 ostracized if he did so in this situation.
 This is common knowledge as well, so Bill knows Anne expects him to defect
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the situation is updated to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

 such that Anne becomes interested in Bill which she secretly writes down
 on a note.
 So Anne is now interested in Bill (
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a}$
\end_inset

), Anne knows Bill is interested in her (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}m_{b}$
\end_inset

), but Bill still does not know Anne is interested in him and Anne knows
 this, since she knows that as far as Bill is concerned, he still believes
 he is in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 So Bill assumes Anne is still disinterested in him and he will defect like
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 and he would be morally blameworthy if he did not.
 Anne knows Bill will defect and she chooses to do the same, as it is in
 both of their interest to not pursue a sexual relation without someone
 who does not reciprocate.
 Even though Anne is interested in Bill in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

, if Bill where to pursue a relation to her, Anne would be right to berate
 Bill, since if Bill behaves consistently, this means would have done it
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 as well which we have established as wrong.
 So far so good, we accept that both Anne and Bill defects.
 We have also established that it would be wrong for Bill to do 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

, because since he cannot tell 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

 apart, it means that he would have done it in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 as well, which was clearly impermissible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

Now assume a further updated situation 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 where Bill secretly reads Anne's note, learning that she is interested
 in him.
 While Bill has learned that Anne is interested in him, Anne does not know
 this and Bill is aware of Anne's ignorance.
 So the move from 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 is unnoticeable for Anne and Bill knows this.
 We have already established that Anne would not like Bill to pursue a sexual
 relation with her in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

, so the same holds for Anne in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Bill knows that nothing changed for Anne, so he chooses to defect.
 If he had done 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

, even after reading her secret diary that she is interested in him, it
 might seem like he did so in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

 from Anne's point of view, at which point it is indistinguishable for Anne
 whether Bill knows he is in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that for Anne to recognize this, she has to perform first-order
 reasoning, as she has to consider Bill's beliefs which from her point of
 view includes 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot m_{a}$
\end_inset

, enough to put blame on Bill if he chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $!P_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 For Bill to know this about Anne, he has to consider her first-order reasoning,
 which implies second-order reasoning from Bill.
 Both of these cases are empirically plausible in terms of cognitive capacities.

Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $s_{4}$

 where Anne secretly notices that Bill reads her diary.
 So Bill is interested in Anne (established in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

).
 Anne is interested in Bill (established in
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Anne knows Bill is interested in her (it is common knowledge in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 Bill knows Anne is interested in him (he read her secret note in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 Anne now knows that Bill knows that Anne is interested in Bill (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}K_{b}m_{a}$
\end_inset

, as she secretly saw him read her note).
 But Bill does not know this epistemic fact! So alas, when Bill has to choose
 whether to make a move or not, he is still in the same position as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 and will choose to defect.
 Same as before, since Anne knows that Bill is in a situation similar to
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 where she would be right to berate him had he pursued a sexual relation
 to her, she knows the same still holds and chooses to defect as well.
 As Anne has gained one more iteration of epistemic knowledge in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{4},$
\end_inset

 Anne now also depend on second-order social reasoning.

\begin_layout Standard
Now introduce the last situation 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{5}$
\end_inset

 where Bill secretly realizes that Anne saw him reading her note.
 So we add that Bill knows that Anne knows that Bill knows that Anne is
 interested in Bill (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}K_{a}K_{b}m_{a}$
\end_inset

).
 Like earlier, nothing changed for Anne.
 So due to second-order reasoning Anne will still expect Bill to not pursue
 a relation with her, and find him morally blameworthy if he does so anyway,
 and since Bill knows this, he ideally will defect.
 To summarize, Anne and Bill are interested in each other.
 It is common knowledge that Bill is interested in Anne.
 Bill knows Anne is interested in him so it is mutual knowledge that they
 are interested in each other.
 Anne knows that Bill knows this, and Bill knows that Anne knows this, so
 it is even mutual knowledge that it is mutual knowledge that they are intereste
d in each other, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}m_{\{a,b\}}$
\end_inset

.
 But neither know this epistemic fact! Now for the crux of the argument.
 While Anne still relies on second-order social reasoning, Bill needs to
 apply third-order reasoning to reason sufficiently about her iterated beliefs
 in order to know she will berate him for pursuing a sexual relation with
 her.
 So since Bill is interested in Anne, knows she is interested in him and
 knows that she knows that he knows this, he might pursue a relation with
 Anne because the third-order reasoning required for Bill to correctly attribute
 second-order beliefs to Annie are cognitively out of reach.
 But not just this, the findings from the canteen dilemma concerning lack
 of introspection indicate that Bill is not aware of this limitation.
 So Bill cannot predict nor understand why Anne defects or why his action
 was morally blameworthy.
 The possible reasoning for Bill to stop defecting in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{5}$
\end_inset

 could be some default reasoning kicking in, which assumes common knowledge
 to exist whenever two or more iterations of mutual knowledge is established.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does this mean? When Bill evaluates whether or not to do some action
 in situation above, he has to evaluate how it will be viewed by Anne.
 We assume that Bill is consistent in his actions.
 If Bill thinks that Anne will find 
\begin_inset Formula $!P_{b}$
\end_inset

 morally acceptable in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{5}$
\end_inset

, where Anne is in an equivalent state as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{4}$
\end_inset

, he has to believe it is acceptable for her in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{4}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{4}$
\end_inset

 are indistinguishable for Bill, he therefore must think it is acceptable
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 as well (where he just read her note).
 But remember in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

, Anne might think she is in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So from Anne's perspective, Bill doing 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3}$
\end_inset

 is judged as if Anne was in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 And in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

, Anne does not know if Bill makes a does 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 from the perspective of 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

(indistinguishable for Bill), so Bill must think it acceptable to make a
 move in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 as well, where Bill believes Anne is not interested in him, which has been
 established as morally impermissible.

\begin_layout Standard
This is just reverse route of inferring why making a move would be wrong
 for Bill in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{5}$
\end_inset

, but notice that it shows that if Bill would do 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 in some 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset

 he has to consider how it is evaluated by Anne in the situation before
 it, which also depends on how it would be perceived in the situation before
 that.
 So without common knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\{a,b\}}$
\end_inset

, there is no strategy for Anne and Bill that involves 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 which does not involve the possibility of discoordination.
 One might argue that it is simply not morally blameworthy for Bill to choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{5}$
\end_inset

.
 But remember that whenever we say 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 is deemed morally permissible by some agent in a situation, we must also
 say that it is morally permissible in situations which are indistinguishable
 for that agent.
 It is also possible to hold a moral theory such that the permissibility
 of an agent doing an action depends only on the mental states of others
 and not on the agents knowledge of such mental states.
 This would amount to an error-theory, such that even in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

, where Anne secretly writes down that she is interested in Bill, it would
 be permissible for Bill to pursue a relation with Anne and our intuitions
 about the situation are simply wrong.
 Arguing against this is outside the scope of this thesis, but it might
 suffice to say that it is not a practically viable moral theory.
 One might argue that while Bill should not do 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 after reading Anne's note, because from Anne's perspective it is extensively
 the same as when Bill believes Anne to be disinterested, but still argue
 that Bill should do 
\begin_inset Formula $!P$
\end_inset

 after Anne realizes Bill read her note.
 But this implies Bill will somehow behave differently given the same informatio
n (since the situations are indistinguishable for Bill).

 Agents might realize the implications in one situation, and therefore defect
 and but then do

 in different situation where they have more information but still no common

 The possible lack of introspection entails that they cannot foresee the
 negative consequences of social discoordination and they possibly cannot
 understand how it might have happened, meaning that neither the moral implicati
ons can be dealt with nor can future behavior be adjusted.
 This whole section can be stated explicitly in the terms of certain social
 interactions requiring consent.
 Even under the assumption of morally well-intentioned people, certain interacti
ons requires common knowledge about consent, not just private or mutual
 knowledge of consent.
 Any finite iteration of mutual knowledge of consent is not sufficient if
 we want to avoid the risk of discoordination entirely.
 This section is intended as describing the practical consequences of being
 limited both in terms of higher-order social reasoning and in terms of
 proper introspection into this very limitation.
 While the normative implications of this are not discussed further, this
 section is not meant to be defeatist, since the problem of lacking common
 knowledge can be solved by clear communication.
 This section is rather intended as describing how cognitive limits can
 have consequences which we want to avoid, and which we can only avoid if
 we become aware of the structures that lead to them.
 This implies reconsidering if the necessary common knowledge is established
 when dealing with complicated situations where successful social interaction
 is paramount.

\begin_layout Section
\noindent
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Our findings indicate that the capacity for higher order social reasoning
 might exist in various degrees which are not captured by the approximation
 of assuming a capacity for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order of social reasoning but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the complex and still somewhat enigmatic nature of this otherwise
 well-researched cognitive ability, it is also important to develop and
 properly define terminology of the broad cognitive capacity originally
 referred to as 'theory of mind' by Premack and Woodruff 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Premack chimp ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is difficult however before the diversity and complexity involved
 is better understood.
 Our results indicates that there is more cognitive diversity in terms of
 higher order social reasoning than what a traditional categorization of
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 order reasoning implies.
 Like other studies have suggested, this calls for research investigating
 the possible diversity of processes involved in reasoning about and understandi
ng the minds of others.
 Our own research aids in this, as accepting the possibility of continuous
 degrees of higher order social reasoning possibly indicates that some might
 be in different stages of gaining appreciation for higher order of social
 reasoning.
 This and similar research on the diversity on this complex cognitive capacity
 can in turn help with reconstructing a better scientific terminology to
 describe it.
