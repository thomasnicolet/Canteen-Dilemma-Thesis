The present thesis is on an experiment called the 'Canteen Dilemma' conducted
 at the Center for Information and Bubble Studies.
 The thesis consists of an article on the canteen dilemma accompanied by
 an introduction to related areas of research.
 The canteen dilemma is a two-player coordination game with imperfect informatio
n.
 The aim of the experiment is to show how people act and reason in coordination
 problems where higher-order social reasoning can influence players decisions.
 Each player are assigned an arrival time between 8:00 am and 9:10 am in
 each round of the game.
 Both players know their own arrival time and that the other player arrived
 10 minutes before or after themselves.
 Players have to decide to go to the office or the canteen and the goal
 of the game is for both players to make the same choice.
 The game involves a payoff structure such that the players prefer to go
 to the canteen together over the office, while having a strong preference
 for avoiding making either differing choices or going to the canteen at
 9:00 am or later.
 This structure entails that each players decision depend on both the state
 of the world (the possible arrival times) and the decision of the other
 player.
 Much like many strategic games, this means that the reasoning in the game
 hinges on the mental capacity to correctly attribute mental states to others
 such as beliefs and intentions.
 This capacity has most notably been referred to as 'theory of mind' or
 broadly as social cognition and reasoning, although it has also been referred
 to by numerous other terms.
 Social cognition or reasoning can be iterated recursively, modeling the
 mental states of others including their mental model of oneself and so
 on.
 Recursive higher-order reasoning can be modeled in epistemic logic, which
 is also presented and discussed.
 As with any cognitive capacity, there are limitations to social reasoning.
 I also discuss these limits and how they relate to making psychologically
 realistic logical models of reasoning agents.

The canteen dilemma itself investigates the degree to which social cognition
 plays a role in coordination problems without common knowledge.
 While various studies indicate that children develop various socio-cognitive
 abilities, research also shows that adults are most often capped at a second-or
der theory of mind.
 Some studies even show that adults in some cases do not consult their theory
 of mind even in when it is salient for the task at hand.
 Results from the canteen dilemma indicate that participants rely on second-orde
r reasoning at most.
 The experiment also showed that the orders of social reasoning could be
 expressed in degrees of belief.
 This is contrary to traditional false belief tasks which generally express
 the 
\emph on
presence 
\emph default
of a belief.
 It tests whether test subjects gives a specific answer or not in relation
 to correctly attributing a false belief to a character in a story task,
 which implies that either subjects have a belief about another belief or
 they do not.
 This finding in the canteen dilemma call for testing the possible sociocognitiv
e diversity even in those having a first-order theory of mind but not second-ord
er.
 The canteen dilemma also indicated that participants had poor introspection
 in their limited theory of mind.
 Given the centrality of social cognition in terms of successful social
 interaction, the related cognitive limitations coupled with a lack of introspec
tion can have adverse consequences in everyday life.
 Social cognition is also of interest in various fields from developmental
 psychology, biology, neuroscience, game theory to philosophy.
 I discuss the importance of empirical research on social cognition in relation
 to logic and argue why it enables problems in normative ethics to be reformulat
ed in epistemic terms.
