\begin_layout Title
The Canteen Dilemma - An Experiment on Higher Order Social Reasoning 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Thomas S.
 Nicolet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This article introduces the Canteen Dilemma experiment and presents how
 it combines interests from cognitive science and logic by looking at a
 specific type of social cognition, namely higher order social reasoning.
 Social interaction often rely implicitly or explicitly on higher order
 social reasoning - what do you think, that I think and so on.
 Such reasoning has been modeled in epistemic logics, although real reasoning
 rarely follow the proscriptions of these logics.
 I here introduce the Canteen Dilemma as an experiment which offers insight
 into how real people reason and discuss the implications for logic as viewed
 as a theory of rational agency.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction (revise)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Successful social interaction often requires us to reason about the mental
 states of others.
 This type of reasoning, higher order social reasoning, also called having
 a Theory of Mind, can help us understand and predict the behavior of others
 by being able to think and reason about their mental states, including
 their knowledge, beliefs or intentions.
 Higher order Theory of Mind means the capacity to recursively model the
 mental states of others, including the other's mental models of oneself,
 and so on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such higher order social reasoning can also described in various epistemic
 logics and the interface between logic and cognitive science has recently
 been gathering interest.
 There lies a two-fold question in this field: To what extend does real
 reasoning about the mental states of others differ from the prescriptions
 from pure epistemic logic, what how does logic and cognitive science react
 to possible divergence? In this article I first discuss the relation between
 logic and empirical facts about human reasoning.
 I then present some logical theory before I go into results about real
 social cognition from cognitive science.
 I use this as an introduction to the Canteen Dilemma experiment.
 Since essential details of the experiment are fleshed out in the accompanying
 article, I will keep to discussing results from the experiment which were
 not included in the original article.
 This will include supplementary discussion and possible improvements for
 future experimental research.

Logic and the facts - from Frege to Benthem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic has traditionally been thought of as only concerned with inference
 in the form of logical consequence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There has recently been a recent increasing interest in the interface between
 logic and cognitive science, most notably found in Johan van Benthem's
 paper 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Logic and reasoning: Do the facts matter?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Logic has two roots - the study of real arguments in everyday life and
 the more pure study of axiom-based proof patterns.

\begin_layout Subsection
Real higher order social reasoning 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following and understanding the application of higher order social reasoning
 can be significantly difficult even in examples from epistemic logic with
 precise formalisation.
 When it comes to application of such reasoning in ordinary language and
 in cases where such reasoning might not be explicitly prompted and perhaps
 even time constrained, it turns out to be near impossible.
 
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies show that children develop the ability to apply first order ToM
 in relation to a false belief task by the age of 4, while the ability to
 pass a similar task requiring second order ToM only develops a few years
 later.
 Studies with adults (Hedden and Zhang (2002)) suggest that they generally
 apply first order Theory of Mind successfully while their second-order
 Theory of Mind reasoning can also be seriously flawed.

The importance of Theory of Mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Successful social interaction often requires ToM.
 Furthermore, if we have to interact successfully with artificial agents,
 it's important that proper mental models are used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even when the use of ToM is severely limited, the study of its occurrence
 in real social reasoning is important for two reasons.
 First, if our standard intuitions concerning ToM are flawed, being made
 aware of possible shortcomings allows us to counteract and adjust for these
 shortcomings.
 This is important in the cases where the lack of ToM means foregoing pareto-eff
icient outcomes.
 Like Benthem writes, human cognition often manages to integrate formally
 designed practices (like games or puzzles into our common sense behavior
 such that we can navigate and act within these structures without being
 attentively aware of the processing going into it.

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, even when real applications of ToM might deviate from certain
 logical proscriptions, it's not necessarily flawed.
 After all, people cooperate successfully all the time without acting on
 perfect logical reasoning and rationality, exactly because such behavior
 is rather robust.
 But if humans deviate from strictly rational behavior, artificial agent
 haves take this into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, as Benjamin Erb argues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Erb - AI and ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, when optimizing intelligent human-computer interaction it's important
 that both humans and their non-human counterparts can reason about the
 'mental' states of each other.
 That is, for non-human agents to successfully predict and reason about
 the behavior of humans, they will have to simulate a human mental model
 and the usefulness on such a model hinges on how accurately the model represent
s the actual mental state of the human, which makes normative questions
 void for a moment.
 This also holds the other way around turn, as Erb writes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In intelligent, technical environments, humans may intrinsically apply ToM
 traits to their non-human interaction partners
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Humans may in other words also attribute a 'mental' model to non-human
 interaction partners concerning the reasoning and intentions behind their
 actions.
 This model also has to accurately represent the reasoning of the non-human
 and for humans to accomplish such a feat, the non-human might have to employ
 human-like reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

Knowledge of ToM and language use would be very useful in designing conversation
al agents, because if humans draw inferences differently, depending on the
 nature of the situation, artificial agents should also do so, and should
 be able to take into account that oth ers may do so.

\begin_layout Standard
In intelligent, technical environments, humans may intrinsically apply ToM
 traits to their non-human interaction partners.
 When designing humanoid agents, self-driving cars, or ambient technologies,
 it becomes important to factor in the human ToM.
 Once humans assign intentions, motives, or beliefs to their non-human counterpa
rts, these thoughts inherently become part of their interaction space and
 must be considered carefully.

The limit of Theory of Mind use in adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even adults often don't apply sufficient ToM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spontaneous versus reflective use of Theory of Mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there's evidence suggesting that this ability might not be effectively
 be drawn upon in spontaneous use cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Task dependence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ToM might not be a uniform type of social cognition.
 It's possibly task dependent, which could indicate that it's made up of
 different reasoning patterns.
 A possible explanation for this could be that theory of mind is more akin
 to a craft than a theory.
 A typical example is that we typically know how to ride a bike without
 having an explicit theory of how to do it.
 We can make a distinction between know-that and know-how.
 We can also make the inverse argument, that someone knows the theory of
 how to ride a bike, or play some sport, without being able to draw sufficiently
 on this knowledge in practice.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider (Wason 1971) to see that a thematic story might aid in logical
 reasoning much more than an abstract story.
 This is supported by (Meijering 2010), but this might have been counter
 productive in our case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
It's a possibility that employing ToM is a craft that's not sufficiently
 practiced among most people.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Common knowledge about rationality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's also a divergence about in games which could be explained by saying
 that rationality isn't common knowledge.
 If a player can't expect the other player to play rationally, she cannot
 be expected to play rationally either.
