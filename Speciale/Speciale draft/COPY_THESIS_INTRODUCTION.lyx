\begin_layout Abstract
It is often necessary to correctly attribute mental states to others in
 order to interpret or predict their behavior correctly.
 This capacity is often referred to as 'theory of mind'.
 Although it seems natural to interpret the behavior of others in terms
 of mental traits, the reasoning involved is notoriously difficult and subsequen
tly limited.
 This thesis revolves around an experiment deviced in conjunction with R.
 Engelhardt (CIBS) and T.
 Bolander (DTU Computer) conducted at the Center for Information and Bubble
 Studies (CIBS).
 This introduction to the article on the experiment presents both how cognitive
 research on theory of mind relates to logic as well as presenting empirical
 findings from cognitive science which are relevant for understanding the
 canteen dilemma.
 I motivate interdisciplinary work between logic and cognitive science by
 arguing that empirical insights are necessary in order for logic to make
 psychologically realistic models of agents, which benefits both cognitive
 science by providing insights into the computational complexity involved
 in human reasoning as well as allowing artificial intelligent technology
 to behave more human-like.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often necessary to be able to attribute mental states to others and
 reason about them in order to successfully navigate our social world.
 The focus of this thesis is this cognitive capacity and more specifically
 its limitation.
 The sociocognitive capacity to correctly attribute mental states to others
 is what allows self-conscious beings like humans acknowledge and appreciate
 that other people have mental states of their own, including intentions,
 beliefs, emotions and so on.
 This capacity therefore plays a pivotal role in human interaction and has
 been described as the pinnacle of social cognition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "clayton "
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This sociocognitive capacity was originally referred to as 'theory of mind'
 in the seminal paper by Premack & Woodruff 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Premack chimp ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in 1978.
 It has seen implicit philosophical attention for centuries and been of
 immense scientific interest in the last 40 years within studies such as
 psychology, biology, neuroscience and philosophy.
 This thesis revolves around an experiment called the canteen dilemma conducted
 at the Center for Information and Bubble Studies.
 My thesis consists of an article on the canteen dilemma as well as this
 present paper which works as an introduction to the article.
 The article aims at investigating the nature and limited application of
 theory of mind in a strategic coordination game with imperfect information.
 The present introduction is intended to supplement the accompanying article
 by presenting and discussing relevant research on social cognition, how
 and why it is relevant to research in logic, as well as providing supplementary
 results and discussion on the canteen dilemma experiment itself.

It is necessary to preface some of the discussion on social cognition with
 some reservations.
 The field has been criticized in terms of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theory of mind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being used vaguely and inconsistently between studies and by arguing that
 such studies specifically (i) treat theory of mind as a monolithic process,
 (ii) refer to a single brain network for theory of mind and (iii) conflate
 varieties of theory of mind 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schaafsma deconstructing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Other studies have argued that certain studies which point to cases of
 theory of mind could be explained without reference to mental states.
 This calls for a critical assessment of the scientific understanding of
 theory of mind as a uniform capacity of representing the mental states
 of others.
 This will be discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 as well.
 Social cognition has also been referred to as 'mentalizing' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes submentalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 'mind-reading' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, 'perspective taking'

 and 'higher-order social cognition/reasoning' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "social intelligence,verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Given the canteen dilemma's emphasis on reasoning about possible mental
 states of others in order to inform one's decisions, I will often refer
 to this capacity as higher-order social reasoning or cognition, sometimes
 just higher-order reasoning.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these complexities, the phenomena of attributing mental states to
 others is undeniably real and important.
 However construed, the ability allows us to not just predict the behavior
 of others, but also predict how our own behavior might affect the mental
 states of others.
 As such, this capacity allows us to develop a more complete and accurate
 understanding of the inner workings of those around us and as such is an
 essential part of understanding what it means to be human.
 The reasoning involved can be applied recursively, modeling the mental
 state of others, including their model of one's own mental state, and so
 on.
 This recursive modeling of the mental states of others is referred to as
 higher-order social reasoning or cognition and it is this cognitive activity
 that is the general focus of the canteen dilemma experiment and this thesis.

\begin_layout Standard
Epistemic logic, the modal logic of knowledge, is useful for representing
 mental states like knowledge so it occurs to be a natural tool for describing
 higher-order social reasoning.
 In general, we can say zero-order reasoning concerns facts about the world,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-order reason concerns facts about 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order reasoning of other people 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since higher order social reasoning can be described in various epistemic
 logics, the interface between logic and cognitive science has recently
 received interest.
 There is a two-fold question in this interdisciplinary field: To what extent
 do people reason differently from logical prescriptions and what does such
 possible divergence mean for both fields? The latter question will be discussed
 in the section below.
 After this I present the epistemic logic 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

 before I give an overview of insights from experimental cognitive science,
 focusing on the possible limits of human reasoning.
 This works as an introduction to the canteen dilemma.
 As the essential details and results of the experiment are fleshed out
 in the accompanying article, this thesis will describe and discuss supplementar
y results of the experiment.

Logic and the facts - from Frege to Benthem
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Logic-and-the"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic bears a long but intricate relation to human reasoning.
 The logic of argumentation has been studied since antiquity and is still
 frequently taught to first year philosophy students.
 The goal of this is presumably not just to teach students about valid inference
s but intended to improve the validity of the inferences they make themselves.
 Besides this, logic has traditionally been thought of as independent of
 empirical facts.
 Logic has been viewed as a normative force of how we ought to make inferences.
 The relationship between human reasoning and logic is not as neatly demarcated
 as some might think however.
 Development within epistemic logic especially has in recent years been
 undergoing a cognitive turn, notably proposed by logicians as Johan van
 Benthem and Rineke Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "benthem facts matter,verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

This cognitive turn is a step away from the anti-psychologism espoused from
 the beginning of modern logic , as Frege stated that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logic is concerned .
 .
 .
 not with the question of how people think, but with the question of how
 they must think if they are not to miss the truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 250"
key "frege1897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Frege refers to the normativity of logic but his point rests on a more
 fundamental claim that logic is the study of objective mind-independent
 logical laws, as he states explicitly: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the laws of truth are not psychological laws: they are boundary stones set
 in an eternal foundation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 13"
key "frege 1964"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In other words, logic gets its normativity because the norms for our reasoning
 and beliefs are structured by what is truth-conducing and the laws of logic
 are objective truths, in fact necessary and eternal truths.
 Husserl followed Frege in this anti-psychologism and even argued that any
 argument that makes logic independent from psychology rely on the distinction
 between how we ought to think and how do do think as implicitly psychologistic,
 since any such argument still refers to human reasoning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "neo-kantianism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 So for Frege and Husserl, the normativity of logic is a side-effect of
 its objectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectivity of logic has been part of a fundamental philosophical debate
 about what makes logical truths true, what logical facts are about and
 whether they are necessarily or contingently true.
 There is a rich historical discussion on this from Wittgenstein, Ayer,
 Carnap, Quine, Kripke and Putnam among others which is not directly relevant
 for the question of normativity due the following argument.
 Assume we reject Frege's view and adopt a non-Platonistic Realism like
 Maddy  
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "maddy phil of logic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or a more radical empirical version from Quine 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Quine"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which states that the truth of logical laws are contingent on the physical
 structuring.
 Then we can still hold onto the normativity of logic because even within
 such a view, human reasoning takes place within the context of this physical
 structuring.
 How does empirical facts relate to logic then? 
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us start with argumentative logic.
 There are certain inferences that humans make that can only be described
 as mistakes.
 Modus Ponens for example, from 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P\rightarrow Q$
\end_inset

, we can conclude 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, describes a valid inference which people often depend on and failing to
 appreciate it can have adverse consequences.
 But there are other complex cases where human reasoning might not be easily
 described in a logical model, but where its not necessarily a mistake in
 reasoning.
 There are few reasons for this which encourage collaboration between logic
 and cognitive science.
 First, if people make inferences which are invalid in classical logic,
 we cannot deduce that they made a logical mistake because classical logic
 might not describe their reasoning very accurately.
 After all, people are most often highly successful in their endeavors even
 if their reasoning seems inconsistent in some logical model.
 This has lead to development of non-monotonic logics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nonmonotonic logic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and default reasoning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "default reasoning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which allows valid inferences on incomplete information which would be
 invalid in classical logic.
 So when human reasoning deviates from logical prescriptions it does not
 mean it is random or illogical.
 People might reason in ways which for most purposes are the most truth-conduciv
e, even if it leads to mistakes sometimes.
 So people reason very differently, and for good reason, so if logic wants
 to maintain its normativity, it should take this seriously.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, in relation to developing artificial intelligence, which was originally
 described as “making machines behave in ways that would be intelligent
 if a human were so behaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by John McCarthy in 1956 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mccarthy ai"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we need to be aware of how people actually reason if we want artificially
 intelligent technology to behave similarly.
 This is especially important when it comes to higher order social cognition.
 If we want to be able to interact intelligently with artificial agents,
 such agents will have to be able to reason about and understand the reasoning
 of humans.
 In other words, if human reasoning deviates systematically from idealized
 logical prescriptions, AI systems would benefit from being able to anticipate
 this by being able to model human reasoning as it is, rather than how it
 ought to be.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

I will now turn to epistemic logic as an example of an idealized representation
 of reasoning about knowledge.
 Epistemic logic was originally used to formalize and analyze epistemological
 notions and concepts and is also useful as a tool for showing the epistemic
 depth of certain real world situations.
 It involves some idealizations which I will discuss before moving onto
 cases of real higher-order social reasoning.

 useful for keeping track of what agents know at specific static stages
 of an informational process.
 I will here introduce the most popular logical system

 which is the epistemic logic most often used to symbolize knowledge, although
 with idealization problems we will turn to later.

The first axiom is entails veridicality and is mostly uncontroversial: if

 The other two implies that if you're aware of what you know and do not

 at realistic social reasoning.

 between them.

 only know something, when it is the case in all worlds they consider possible.

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the actual numbers given are 2 to Anne and 3 to Bill, denoted as
 a state 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

.
 In that case we can infer a few different facts.
 Most basically, Anne know her number is 2 and Bill knows his number is
 3: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}a_{2}\land K_{b}b_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Since they know their numbers are consecutive, they both know that there
 are only two possible numbers for the other (but these are not the same
 for Anne and Bill!): 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(b_{1}\lor b_{3})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}(a_{2}\lor a_{4})$
\end_inset

.
 Since Anne considers it possible that Bill has as 1 or 3, she considers
 it possible that Bill considers 0 or 2 possible (if Bill has 1) or 2 or
 4 possible (if Bill has 3), stated as: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}K_{b}(a_{0}\lor a_{2}\lor a_{4})$
\end_inset

.
 For the more interesting part, imagine that Anne and Bill has to guess
 whether they both have positive numbers, i.e.
 none of them have a 0, denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $M,(x,y)\models(positive)$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $(x\neq0\land y\neq0)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we ask both Anne and Bill in our supposed case if they know that the
 other's number is positive, they would both answer yes: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(positive)\land K_{b}(positive)$
\end_inset

, which can be expressed concatenated as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
 This is equivalent to checking for each agent 
\emph on
i 
\emph default
whether every world which is 
\emph on
i 
\emph default
accessible from 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

 only has positive numbers.
 However, now imagine that we ask both Anne and Bill respectively if they
 both know that no one has a 0 , i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)$
\end_inset

 is true.
 Start with Bill.
 He considers 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(4,3)$
\end_inset

 possible.
 Since we're only focused on 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, we can focus on the lowest number-pair, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

, since the other direction only takes us away from 0.
 Bill thinks it's possible Anne has a 2, which means he knows both numbers
 are positive, and since Anne would then consider 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 as the lowest number, he knows that Anne knows it as well: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}K_{a}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
 But even though Anne in fact has a 2, meaning she knows that both numbers
 are positive since the lowest possible number for Bill would be 1, if Bill
 has a 1, he considers it possible that Anne as a 0.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot K_{a}K_{b}(positive).$
\end_inset

 In other words, while everyone knows that no one has a 0, not everyone
 knows this epistemic fact itself: 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)\land\lnot E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
 Another way to read this off the diagram, is to say that 
\begin_inset Formula $(positive)$
\end_inset

 is mutual knowledge in a world 
\emph on
w 
\emph default
if no one considers worlds with 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The unintuitive aspect of this is the satisfaction of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 iterations of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 operator but not 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 That is, no finite iteration of mutual knowledge is equal to common knowledge.
 So in the consecutive number example, no matter what number pair Anne and
 Bill are given, it is never common knowledge that none of them have a 0!
 The practical implications of this can be seen by 'gamifying' the example.
 Imagine Anne and Bill have to make a binary choice between either both
 having positive numbers or remaining undecided, and they can only win by
 answering the same, without answering both having positive numbers if they
 do not.
 In our supposed case 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

, both agents know they both have positive numbers.
 But since Anne has a 2, she is not sure that Bill knows.
 For all Anne knows, Bill might have a 1 in which case he would not know
 that both have positive numbers.
 For that reason Anne might not answer that no one has a 0, in which case
 Bill should answer the same, even though Bill has a 3.
 This line of reasoning continues for any natural number, but it quickly
 becomes unintuitive since it relies on higher-order theory of mind outside
 human capacity.
 For example if two real people were given 
\begin_inset Formula $(719,720)$
\end_inset

 and asked independently if they would both answer that none of them has
 0, they would probably both agree independently of each other that they
 would both answer that they only had positive numbers.
 People reasoning about the possible number of the other is an individual
 process, but once they have to reason about what the other will answer,
 coordination is required and it turns on their social reasoning.
 It requires that each agent do not just consider the worlds they consider
 possible, but those which other consider possible as well.

 First, passing the false belief task requires other cognitive capacities

 children to fail.
 Second, having a theory of mind involves more than the ability to reason
 about false beliefs.
 That is, even if children younger than 2 years fail the false belief task,
 studies show that they can still appreciate some of the mental states of
 others, like attributing goals to others

 The Wason selection task 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wason 1966,wason 1971"

 was an early experiment showing difficulties with zero-order reasoning.
 In Wason's study, subjects were shown sixteen cards with a letter on one
 side and a number on the other.
 Four of these, D, K, 3, 7 were used.
 Subjects were then asked which cards to turn in order to evaluate whether
 the following claim was true: Every card which has a D on one side has
 a 3 on the other.
 The claim has the structure of the material conditional 
\begin_inset Formula $p\rightarrow q$
\end_inset

.
 The correct cards to turn are those with 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot q$
\end_inset

 but this answer (D and 7) was only the fourth most popular answer, while
 the most popular answer included the logical fallacy of affirming the consequen

While this shows that there might be a non-deficiency explanation even when
 people seem to fail to make correct inferences in propositional logic,
 the fact still stands that people of course do not always reason perfectly.
 Traditional propositional logic also often sets a standard that is low
 enough that it can be met at least in specialized settings where there
 is a special requirement to avoid logical failures.
 So propositional logic might not be overly idealized when it comes to arguments
 (ignoring the fact that propositional logic does not capture the dynamic
 and rhetorical aspects of real arguments).
 It is another story when it comes to higher order social reasoning.
 Before I go into empirical results on higher order social reasoning, let
 us look at some of the overly idealized aspects of 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 implies that agents have unlimited introspection of their own epistemic
 states, that is, they have a perfect account of what they know and do not
 know.
 But there are other idealizations which are less discussed

 To see this, note that real knowledge is gathered in a dynamic social environme
nt, where agents update and change their knowledge and beliefs as they gain
 new information.
 Our epistemic logic can express this by adding action expressions as well
 as dynamic modalities for these.
 This means adding

It is often mentioned that public announcement of an atomic facts makes
 it common knowledge, while the same is not always the case for epistemic
 facts.
 Statements like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Moore-type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentences, which leads to unsuccessful updates.
 When announcing non-epistemic propositions, agents 
\emph on
ought
\emph default
 to come to know it.
 But this rests on the idealized presupposition that agents have perfect
 observation, since the announcement and its contents must be clearly understood
 by all, and perfect recall, since agents must be able to remember everything
 else they know.
 In fact, for an announcement to become common knowledge, perfect observation
 and recall must be common knowledge among agents as well.
 Publicly announcing non-epistemic facts to people does not always bring
 about common knowledge about such facts.
 Statements can either be too complex or lengthy for agents to decipher,
 or the statements might be ambiguous, as some researchers argued in the
 Wason selection task.
 In other words, if the mistakes in the Wason selection has to be put in
 terms of cognitive limits, they might not indicate a limit in computational
 power but rather a limit in observational power.
 As we will see later, limitations in terms of social cognition does not
 seem to occur due to limited zero-order reasoning, it is rather some barrier
 to the modal depth of formulas agents can come to know.
 I will present and discuss such parameters for cognitive limitations as

Parameters (a) to (d) can be understood as logical norms describing limiting
 optimal truth-conducing capacities.
 That is, even if no one is perfect, each parameter is a way in which agents
 could be epistemically better off.
 This is difficult to see with (e) however, where the optimal case is not
 clear, since neither complete epistemic conservatism or revisionism seems
 rational.
 As Liu writes, it might be better to move away from understanding deviations
 from such norms purely negatively as 'limits' or 'bounds' on cognitive
 capacity, and instead see them positively as the different resources that
 agents have and use to successfully accomplish difficult tasks.
 After all, the story of humanity is largely a success story dependent on
 our cognitive prowess, even if so limited.
 As Benthem mentions by paraphrasing Joerg Siekmann, it is not presenting
 a well-olied proof which is the most admirable in a mathematics seminar,
 it is rather the ability to discover a mistake and recover on the spot.
 Rationality on this view is owed to learning from one's mistakes, and as
 Benthem points out, the dynamic behavior involved in this surely depends
 on more mechanisms than inference alone.
 This is just to present an alternative picture which can discuss limitations
 of human reasoning while still acknowledging its strengths.
 I will now present and discuss some empirical results concerning higher
 order social cognition.

The development and importance of theory of mind

\begin_layout Standard
The cognitive capacity of having a theory of mind is what allows humans
 to traverse and navigate our incredibly complex social world.
 It does this by allowing us to predict and understand the behavior of others
 as well as reason about what mental states they might attribute to us based
 on the behavior we exhibit.
 Some have even argued that self-consciousness evolved exactly to enable
 primates to attribute mental states to others, as this mental attribution
 is essential for interacting successfully in an increasingly complex social
 life

Second, even when human reasoning deviates from certain logical proscriptions
 it is not necessarily a logical mistake in the sense that they failed to
 make a crucial inference.
 It is possible that they made a correct inference in another logical framework.
 After all, people cooperate successfully all the time without perfect logical
 reasoning.
 Furthermore, if we are to design artificial agents which has to understand
 and predict human actions, they would be wrong to assume that humans reasons
 like themselves.
 In fact, as Benjamin Erb argues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Erb - AI and ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, when optimizing intelligent human-computer interaction it is important
 that both humans and their non-human counterparts can reason about the
 'mental' states of each other.
 That is, for non-human agents to successfully predict and reason about
 the behavior of humans, they will have to simulate a human mental model
 and the usefulness of such a model hinges on how accurately the model represent
s the actual mental state of the human.
 This also holds the other way around, as Erb writes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In intelligent, technical environments, humans may intrinsically apply ToM
 traits to their non-human interaction partners
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Humans may in other words also attribute a 'mental' model to non-human
 interaction partners concerning the reasoning and intentions behind their
 actions.
 This leads us to the variety of ways social cognition can be limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The difficulty of reading minds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different ways in which human cognition seems to be limited
 in terms of higher order social reasoning.
 It is limited in the sense that it is seemingly capped at first or second-order
 reasoning.
 Studies show that most adults in game-like settings can utilize first-order
 reasoning and do a good attempt at second-order reasoning, while having
 a higher order theory of mind is rare 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Flobbeverbrugge etc 2008,hedden2002,Verbrugge 2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 There are signs of more severe limitation however, indicating that even
 when people have a capacity for higher-order social reasoning, it is not
 always acted upon or applied reliably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spontaneous versus reflective use of theory of mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental studies show that there is a relevant difference between having
 a theory of mind and actually using it.
 Keysar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that there is a stark dissociation between having the ability to
 reflectively distinguish one's beliefs from others and the routine deployment
 of this ability in interpreting the actions of others.
 Their findings imply that even adults who are capable of forming reasonable
 beliefs about the beliefs of others do not consult this crucial knowledge
 when interpreting the actions of others.
 Their claim is specific to the relatively late developing theory of mind
 aspect of representing beliefs as separate from corresponding reality,
 that is, acknowledging that others might have a myriad of mutually exclusive
 beliefs.
 It suggests a difference between being able to utilize one's theory of
 mind in reflective tasks and utilizing it for guiding one's spontaneous
 actions.

\begin_layout Standard
Birch & Bloom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 show that when adults attribute beliefs to others, they are more likely
 to attribute their own beliefs they know to be true than to attribute false
 beliefs.
 They write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adult's own knowledge of an event's outcome can compromise their ability
 to reason about another person's beliefs about that event
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 College aged adults were told a story where a girl Vicky puts her violin
 in a blue container.
 While Vicky is outside, her sister Denise puts the violin in a different
 container, depending on the treatment, either (Ignorance) simply in another
 container, (plausible knowledge) moves violin to the red container or (implausi
ble knowledge) moves the violin to the purple container.
 When subjects did not know where the violin had been moved, they where
 generally good at predicting that Vicky would look in the blue container.
 When they knew the violin was moved to the red container however, they
 assigned significantly higher probabilities to Vicky looking in the red
 container.
 That is, when attributing beliefs to others, it seems as if subjects to
 an extend simply modeled their mental state as their own.
 The authors call this the the curse of knowledge and is related to the
 problem in Keysar et al.
 as well.
 Both show that theory of mind use might be task dependent, which we will
 look at now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Task dependence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations described above suggest that successful application of theory
 of mind can be task-dependent, successfully applied in some contexts but
 not in others.
 Understanding why this ability might be task dependent can lead to better
 understanding the nature of higher order social cognition.
 Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 lists a few possible explanations.
 First, there might be a high processing cost associated with theory of
 mind, causing a failure in applying appropriate order of social cognition
 when the the processing cost becomes too high.
 Second, the capacity for performing higher order social reasoning does
 not necessarily transfer between domains.
 Being apple to apply this cognitive capacity across domains might require
 a development process like Representational Redescription to take place
 as suggested by Karmiloff-Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Karmiloff"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, in order to utilize a higher order theory of mind in a situation,
 it is not just necessary to possess this capacity, but also to recognize
 that it is advantageous to incorporate this knowledge into actions, decisions
 or interpretation of the actions of others.
 This is in line with the explanation that applying higher order social
 reasoning has a high processing cost.
 In other words, due to the high processing cost of applying it, we do not
 rely on it per default, so it the reflective use might be largely ignored
 until it becomes sufficiently apparent that it is worth the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is further supported by an argument in Keysar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as to why adults do not always deploy their existing theory of mind.
 They mention that in the real word, perspectives often tend to coincide.
 In other words, most knowledge would be common knowledge.
 In that case, differentiating between one's own beliefs and the beliefs
 of others might not be very beneficial, especially if this activity would
 take up vital cognitive resources.
 Another related reason for failing to apply an existing theory of mind
 is that the the cost of failing to apply it might not make it worthwhile
 to apply it per default.
 As Keysar et al.
 mentions, the dynamic nature of face-to-face interactions give people a
 feedback mechanism which allows them to be egocentric by effectively distributi
ng the burden of applying appropriate order social reasoning across interlocutor
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, theory of mind not be a uniform of social cognition at all.
 Without taking a complete behaviorist stance, one might even question to
 what extend theory of mind is a mental capacity at all.
 In other words, when people use their theory of mind to interpret the actions
 of others in terms of mental traits, there might not be much reasoning
 happening.
 For example when a person hears a cyclist use their bell, they are likely
 to infer that the person doing it is impatient and there being a specific
 intention behind the sound.
 But this is likely inferred so spontaneously that it does not seem right
 to say that people hear the sound and then explicitly reason about what
 it might mean.
 We might say that phenomenologically the ringing bell 
\emph on
sounds
\emph default
 like someone is being impatient, that is, the behavior is understood directly
 as an example of impatience, rather than being processed as pure sound
 first.
 This explains why social reasoning appears so extensively in everyday interacti
on, but also why it is difficult in more complex situations, since people
 might rarely be aware of the explicit use of their higher order social
 cognition.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concludes the general to different logical and empirical aspects of
 higher order social cognition which underlies the canteen dilemma.
 Logical prescriptions often help us navigating how humans ought to reason,
 but as we have seen, in order to make prescriptive norms for higher order
 social reasoning, it is necessary to look at the actual reasoning done
 by real people.
 This leads us to the canteen dilemma, an experiment on coordination with
 imperfect information, conducted at the Center for Information and Bubble
 Studies at the University of Copenhagen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Canteen Dilemma

 It depicts a situation with two agents who have mutual knowledge about
 something iterated several times (everyone knows that, everyone knows that
 ...) while never having common knowledge (everyone knows that, everyone knows
 that ...
 infinitely iterated).
 The structure is framed in a thematic story since studies show that this
 can significantly improve people's logical reasoning abilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or specifically their zero-order reasoning which is not the focus of the
 canteen dilemma.
 The story is the following: Each player is told that they and their colleague
 arrive for work every morning between 8:00 am and 9:10 am.
 They always arrive 10 minutes apart but only know their own arrival time.
 Their preferences are ordered such that their prefer (1) going to the canteen
 together if both arrive before 9:00 am, (2) going to the office together
 at any time and (3) all other configurations, that is, discoordination
 or either player going to the canteen at 9:00 am or later.
 The game consists of a number of rounds where each player are assigned
 an arrival time and have to decide between going to the canteen or the
 office.
 The payoff structure follows a logarithmic scoring rule, meaning participants
 gave an estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of how certain they were that they made the right, assigning 
\begin_inset Formula $100-p$
\end_inset

 to being wrong.
 Research on eliciting belief have shown that forecasts from observers through
 proper scoring rules are significantly more accurate and calibrated

\begin_layout Standard
The rules dictate that players prefer going to the canteen if they both
 arrive before 9:00, but that they should always go to the office if they
 or their colleague arrives at 9:00 or 9:10.
 Take the following example to see some of the complexity of the game.
 Assume player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:50.
 Player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
know that 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40 or 9:00.
 If the 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 9:00, 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 should go to the office.
 If
\emph on
 b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40, they would prefer going to the canteen together.
 Player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
knows they prefer going to the canteen but since one of the possible scenarios
 would require him to go to the office assume player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
chooses the office at 8:50.
 Now assume 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 arrives at 8:40 instead and reasons the following way.
 If 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
arrives at 8:50 am and reasons like 
\emph on
a, 
\emph default
player 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 they would go to the office at 8:50 as well, in which case 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
might go to the office at 8:40 just like they did at 8:50.
 This line of reasoning can be done for all possible arrival times by backwards
 induction, and so 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
might never choose to go to the canteen! Notice that for a player who arrives
 at 8:40 knows that the other arrived at 8:50 and that it is therefore preferabl
e for both to go to the canteen.
 However, players do not just have to consider the arrival times of both
 players but also what the other player might do in their circumstances.
 In order to predict the choice the other player might make in their situation,
 the first player has to consider what knowledge they have, which is different
 from their own.
 That is, the player who arrives at 8:40 has to appreciate the fact that
 while she knows that both would prefer going to the canteen, the other
 player does not know this.
 So making an office choice at 8:40 or earlier requires a player to not
 just consider facts about the world, that is, if both arrived before 9:00
 or not, but also consider what the other player would do in this situation,
 which depends on the beliefs of the other player.
 This means that predicting an office choice at 8:40 or earlier relies on
 higher order social reasoning.
 Of course, players can always choose office for whatever reason, for example
 if they just make random choices.
 But we would expect this to be both evenly distributed among both canteen
 and office choices as well as across arrival times.This means that the relative
 difference can still be indicative of reasoning of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice however the premise above that for 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 to go to the office at 8:40, she has to consider how 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
reasons if she arrived at 8:50.
 It means that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
assumes 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to reason like herself
\emph on
.
 
\emph default
So this example does not just assume that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
performs first-order social reasoning but also that she believes 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to apply zero-order reasoning to reach a specific conclusion.
 So it does not just rely on players reasoning a specific way but also that
 it is common knowledge among players that they reason a specific way.
 This means that regardless of what player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
thinks 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
ought to do, 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
has to try and to figure out what 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
will actually do.
 It implies that without common knowledge about rationality, two rational
 players can play sub-optimally.
 They might both choose canteen because they do not believe the other to
 apply the sufficient order of social reasoning, or that the other believes
 that they do and so on.
 While office choices arguably does signify social reasoning, choosing canteen
 does therefore not signify a lack of it.
 This is where the certainty estimates can be valuable.
 Assume a rational player plays the game and arrives at 8:40.
 They might infer that the optimal choice would be going to the office by
 relying on higher order social reasoning, assuming the other thinks the
 same way.
 But if they are uncertain about what type of reasoner the other player
 is, they might believe that the other player might play canteen and they
 can therefore hedge their decision by being less certain.
 So the certainty estimates helps offset some of the loss of possible discoordin
ation if you are able to predict it.
 This makes it possible to distinguish between players all play canteen,
 since those who assign a lower certainty estimate to it than others therefore
 implicitly assign a higher chance to office than others and therefore use
 a higher-order of social reasoning than them.
 This also help deflect what Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"

\end_inset

 calls the danger of simplistic formal systems which posit fixed bounds
 on social cognition, that is, assuming that people can reason up to 
\emph on
n 
\emph default
order but not 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 
\emph default
This will also be the focus when viewing the results later, since it shows
 that natural social cognition might be more continuous than previously
 described.
 Before looking into the results, I will now go through some of the logical
 structure of the game in terms of epistemic logic.
 This leads into discussion of some of the results from the canteen dilemma
 as well as supplementary discussion and results not included in the accompanyin

 so any state but the four right-most one's in 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We can now look at the pointed Kripke model 
\begin_inset Formula $(\text{8:30, 8:40)}$
\end_inset

 where
\emph on
 a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:30 and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
at 8:40.
 Since the proposition 
\emph on
early 
\emph default
is true in every state which either 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
considers possible (connected to, in terms of the graph), they both know
 that they both arrived before 9:00 and that going to the canteen would
 be their preferred choice.
 This epistemic fact is not known by both agents however, since 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
consider it possible that she is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{(8:50, 8:40)}$
\end_inset

, where 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
does not know 
\emph on
early
\emph default
.
 So we have 
\begin_inset Formula $M,(\text{8:40, 8,30)\ensuremath{\models E_{\{a,b\}}(early)\land\lnot E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(early)}}.$

We can now show the structure of the canteen dilemma by relying on logical
 tools rather than joggling multiple iterations of knowledge.
 A player might think that it is not just necessary for 
\emph on
early 
\emph default
to be true in order to make a canteen choice, they must know that it is
 true.
 This excludes the four right-most states in 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

 as mentioned above.
 But since players in the canteen dilemma have to coordinate their actions,
 they have to consider how the other player might act which requires reasoning
 about others reasoning.
 When 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:40 then, where she knows both players arrived before 9:00,
 she does not know that 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
knows.
 If it is necessary for 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to know (
\emph on
early
\emph default
) in order to go the canteen, then 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
considers it possible that 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
does not go to the canteen.
 If we couple this with the assumption that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
does not want to go to the canteen if the other player might not make the
 same choice, then 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
will not go to the canteen at 8:40 either due to reasoning about what the
 other knows about their situation.
 This line of reasoning can be iterated for any earlier arrival time, implying
 that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
will never go to the canteen.
 This is highly unintuitive however.
 Take for example state (8:00, 8:10) where everyone knows that everyone
 knows that everyone knows that everyone knows that it is early enough to
 go to the canteen.
 That is four iterations of mutual knowledge: 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(early)$
\end_inset

.
 But it is not true for five iterations, that is, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(early)$
\end_inset

 is also true in that state.
 So it is not common knowledge that it is early enough to go to the canteen
 and there is in fact no such time where 
\emph on
early 
\emph default
has become common knowledge.
 This can be re-stated by saying that while choosing canteen at 8:50 involves
 a risk, it is impossible to avoid any risk of discoordination no matter
 how early you push back your canteen choice.
 This nuance is hard to accept due to cognitive limits on the higher-order
 social reasoning.
 The multiple iterations of knowledge is therefore another cognitively unrealist
ic idealizations of 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

.
 The next section will present a case study of how epistemic logic might
 deal with this specific limitation.

 have proposed a logical framework capable of modeling various types of

 This is done by modeling degrees of belief by partially ordered preference
 relations 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While others have referred to this as plausibility, I stick to the authors

 Preference relations are motivated by the fact that without them, all epistemic
 alternatives in an 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

 model are deemed equally possible.
 So instead of treating all accessibility relations between states equally,
 it becomes a preference ordering which expresses that agents may consider
 mutually exclusive states possible while considering one more likely than
 the other.
 This is the sense in which agents might 
\emph on

\emph default
 one state over the other.

According to Ditmarsch & Labuschagne, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a psychologically realistic model of an agent capable of interacting intelligent
ly in social situations would be one in which each agent 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 would possess a ToM, comprising, relative to every agent 
\emph on
b
\emph default
, a representation (which may or may not be accurate) of 
\emph on

\end_inset

.
 We can assume this to include a zero-order theory of mind which does not
 represent the state of mind of anyone.
 The authors define a doxastic epistemic model, preference relation and
 degrees of belief.
 Their emphasis lies on the different classes of agents which are characterized
 by their preference relation.
 They first refer to a natural class of agents supposedly modeled after
 children with autism disorder.
 This class would consist of agents 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
who attributes to every agent 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
a preference relation which is identical to their own.
 Second, they refer to an ideal agent 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
who would attribute a mental state to every agent 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
which is identical to the actual mental state of 
\emph on
b
\emph default
.
 Ditmarsch & Labuschagne refer to this as precisely the situation modeled
 by the possible worlds semantics in epistemic logic.
 Third, a deranged agent 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
simply attributes random or innacurate mental states of others without systemati
c patterns.
 Fourth, there is the limited agent who can correctly attribute some but
 not all mental states to others.
 The limited agent is likely the psychologically most realistic one (also
 for developmental disorders).

While Ditmarsch & Labuschagne takes cognitive insights seriously, there
 are some issues.
 As described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, research on social cognition is not as developed as some logicians might
 like to think.
 According to those like Schaafsma et al., it is difficult even for experts
 to navigate what is meant by theory of mind.
 While Ditmarsch & Labuschagne refer to those with autism disorder as having
 a defective theory of mind due to failing a Sally-Anne experiment, as mentioned
 earlier, 20% of the autistic children in the study in question passed the
 test 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Furthermore, some of those with autism disorder can pass theory of mind
 tasks consistently, making some postulate other cognitive impairments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Passing false-belief tasks might not be neither necessary nor sufficient
 at all for having a theory of mind either 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The problem of relating limitations of theory of mind to cognitive disorders
 is the contrast to normal adults, as it does not show how nuanced social
 cognition might be (see Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not bear on the validity of the work of the authors of course.
 Logical theories have an important role to play in the study of higher-order
 social reasoning, but in order to make psychologically realistic models,
 it is important to understand the psychological reality.
 For example as Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 writes, the simulation-theory might describe social cognition better than
 the theory-theory does.
 That is, we might simulate the minds of others rather than reason about
 them, and epistemic logic can then just explain the computational complexity
 of such reasoning.
 Like Ditmarsch & Labuschagne writes, logic might support empirical psychology
 by providing

 explanations for behavior.

\begin_layout Standard
Pol et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pol ToM DEL"

\end_inset

 have formalized theory of mind reasoning as updating beliefs about beliefs
 using dynamic epistemic logic (DEL).
 They found that theory of mind reasoning formalized as such is indeed intractab
le, meaning it can be solved in theory but not in a practical sense due
 to the computational complexity.
 The authors also argue that their findings suggest 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that the intractability of theory of mind is not due to the computational
 demands imposed by ‘higher-order reasoning,’ as often assumed in cognitive
 science.
 Instead, our results suggest that intractability of theory of mind may
 be better sought in the computational demands posed by a more general form
 of reasoning about steps of change in time

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Such results are important for improving our understanding of what makes
 social reasoning so notoriously difficult as well as for implementing and
 simulating social cognition in artificial agents.
 As the authors mention it would be interesting to see other ways to possibly
 bound the order of reasoning in DEL models, since their logic did not do
 so and just found it was intractable.
 Contrary to agents in DEL, human reasoning is bounded by physical constraints
 and not just computational complexity.
 That is, biological organisms are not capable of solving any tractable
 problem.
 I now move on to the lack of introspection in relation to limited social
 reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of introspection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some of cognitive limitations comes with appropriate introspection,
 it is likely that limited social cognition is accompanied with a lack of
 introspection.
 While introspection in terms of zero-order reasoning is possibly easier,
 it becomes a more complex for higher-order reasoning.
 Take an example from the canteen dilemma, where a player utilizes their
 first-order social reasoning to make an office choice at 8:40 but is otherwise
 sure about going to the canteen at 8:30.
 We might explain the canteen choice at 8:30 by higher order social reasoning,
 because the person might believe that it is right to go the office at 8:40
 while thinking that the other player wont make that inference.
 A more plausible explanation could be that going to the office at 8:40
 might have required 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-orders of social reasoning, but going to the office at 8:30 required 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

orders, which were cognitively unavailable to the player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there might be a time where a player becomes certain that canteen is
 the right choice due to limited social reasoning.
 However, this is due to a limitation of the same cognitive processes which
 are required to know that it is false.
 Introspecting one's limited social reasoning arguably requires exactly
 the type of reasoning that is limited.
 We can now look at some of the results from the canteen dilemma.
 The accompanying article will contain the primary results and discussion,
 while the following sections will summarize supplementary results, discussions
 as well as considerations and improvements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Results and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary results of the canteen are listed in the accompanying article.
 I focused primarily on the claimed that adults might not just have varying
 cognitive capacities in regards to the orders of social reasoning they
 can apply, but that there might also exist diversity even within those
 applying 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-order reasoning.
 This was indicated by the certainty estimates given by participants regarding
 how certain they were that the other player made the same choice as them.
 The argument for this conclusion is the following.
 Canteen choices can be interpreted as indicating either a lack of higher-order
 social reasoning or the disbelief that others employs the appropriate social-re
asoning to choose office, but the latter explanation assumes strategic and
 cognitive complexity which might be less plausible than the first explanation.
 That is, if a player imagine themselves as the other player, and performs
 some reasoning, it requires further cognitive effort to infer that the
 other player might not reason like that, or assume that the first player
 reasons like that and so on.
 So canteen choices are arguably a sign of a lack of social-reasoning.
 But since those making canteen choices had varying degrees of certainty
 at different times, meaning they choose canteen at different arrival times,
 with increasing certainty towards earlier arrival times.
 The uncertainty of the other player choosing canteen as well indicates
 social reasoning, assuming that a player would only think the other made
 a office choice if they incorporated higher-order social reasoning.
 But if certainty can be indicative of social reasoning, and certainty continuou
sly or at least not binary, it is possible to have non-binary cognitive
 diversity even among those with capacity for the same orders of social
 cognition.
 People might not be able to perform 2-order reasoning while being closer
 to it than others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting result is the participants lack of introspection into
 the limitations of their higher-order social reasoning.
 The results of the canteen dilemma generally show that players choose the
 office from 8:00 to 8:40, at 8:50 they choose somewhat randomly before
 they opt for the office at 9:00.
 Their certainty estimates indicate social reasoning in the sense that they
 are less certain about going to the canteen at later arrival times.
 But at earlier times, they become certain that the other player has also
 chosen the canteen.
 This makes sense if it is exactly the type of social reasoning which is
 limited that is required to realize that the other player might chose different
ly from them.
 It means that interactions within certain structures like the canteen dilemma
 can not just lead to unsuccesful interaction, it does so without participants
 being able to predict it entirely understand why.
 We will see evidence for this when we look into free-text answers given
 by certain participants, which I will go through below as well as some
 supplementary results not included in the article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supplementary results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first supplementary result shown in Figure 3 below concerns the degree
 to which players changed their decisions throughout the game.
 The blue bars on the plot shows a percentage of players who for example
 chose canteen at 8:00, then got 8:00 again as an arrival time and then
 chose office.
 The orange bar shows the converse for choosing office and later changing
 to canteen.

Reading the plot, only 4 percent of those choosing canteen at 8:00 who actually
 got 8:00 again, chose the office the next time around, while the rest stuck
 with office.
 Due to the limited frequency of players getting the same arrival times
 multiple times, the confidence intervals are rather large.
 There is one interesting point at 8:50 however.
 The plot shows that those arriving at 8:50 one time and getting 8:50 again
 later are more susceptible to change from canteen to office than the other
 way around.
 While the confidence intervals are large, all earlier arrival times had
 evidence pointing towards changing from office to canteen.
 This indicates that there is a form of unique learning happening at 8:50.
 It indicates that higher-orders of social reasoning either does not occur,
 or it becomes established that either player does not believe the other
 player to engage in it.
 The apparent lack of learning of higher-order social reasoning in games
 is also shown in Verbrugge & Mol

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in both the AMT and DTU trials were asked the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What strategy did you use while playing this game?".
 While these answers are harder to quantify than other answers, they provide
 insight into the reasoning and thoughts of the participants.
 This is helpful both because even if behavior in the canteen dilemma is
 correctly explained by a specific type of higher-order social reasoning,
 this is implicit evidence.
 Participants may make decisions because of social reasoning which they
 are not themselves explicitly aware of.
 Explicit strategy answers provide insight into this aspect.
 These answers were quantified by devising a set of categories which the
 answers might fit into the, shown in the table below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the dominating categories was (3) which included answers which simply
 stated their answers was based on time but without much precision.
 Many of these answers had the form of going to the canteen early and office
 later, see for example the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How close to the 9:00 cutoff I arrived at work determined where I would
 go
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This answer is consistent with most if not all strategies, but the most
 plausible interpreation is that it refers to going to the canteen with
 certainty until some time before 9:00, e.g.
 8:40 or 8:50, where either certainty dropped or they changed to office
 choices.
 Other answers also allows better interpretation of behavior in terms of
 higher-order social reasoning.
 See for example the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried to think of the other guy arriving 10 minutes later than I did and
 choose accordingly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This plausibly implies going to the office at 8:50 and canteen at 8:40.
 But does it involve infer representational mental states about the other?
 Possibly not, because the other person's arrival time is a fact about the
 world which they can infer based on their own arrival time.
 That is, when arriving at 8:50, the other person might have arrived at
 9:00 and this can be deduced regardless of the other persons mental state.
 This also implies at 8:40 that when you know you could both get the biggest
 payoff if you both go to the canteen, but you do not consider what the
 other person might choose from their point of view.
 See also the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The farther from 9 the more certain I was of canteen.
 If it was 9 or later I was more certain of office
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Being less than maximally certain about going to the canteen at 8:40 and
 earlier requires higher-order social reasoning, but the answer in question
 does not refer to this reasoning at all.
 Of course they might have without stating it in the question, but it is
 also possible that there is an implicit or automatic reasoning process
 which intuitively informs the participant's choices.
 The reliance of intuition and common sense is also indicated by some answers
 The AMT answer, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Common sense, at least I thought :(
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 indicating both that they relied on common sense while also acknowledging
 that something seemed to go wrong.

Participants in the DTU trials were asked a few supplementary questions
 besides those in the AMT trial.
 Participants in the DTU trial were asked the same question as in the AMT
 trial: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imagine you could have agreed beforehand with your colleague about a point
 in time where it is safe to go to the canteen.
 What time would that be?".
 See Appendix A for a barchart for the related DTU results.
 After answering this question, DTU participants were asked the question
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you ever go to the canteen at an arrival time later than what was safe
 according to your previous answer? Why or why not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They were also asked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you ever choose differently after seeing the same arrival time again
 at a later point in the game? Why or why not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The results were categorized in positive, negative and miscellaneous answers,
 which can be seen in the following barchart.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These answers generally indicate that participants in both DTU trials answered
 positively (63% and 64%) that they did go to the canteen at times later
 than when would have been if they could have made an agreement with their
 colleague (see Appendix A for this result).
 Some of these answers are qualfied with reference to lower certainty, see
 this answer from the first DTU trial: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 Yes I did, but then I could not be very certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
 Other answers are similar, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, at 8:40.
 Because it seemed almost safe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
 Other answers refer to intuition as well: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 Yes, because it was possible, to go there safely and intuitively made sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The last answer was given by a participant answering answering that their
 cutoff for safely going to the canteen would be 8:20.
 This means going to the office at 8:30 (and later) which is indicative
 of second-order reasoning.
 When choosing the canteen at later times anyway, we might theorize that
 it is because they depend on social reasoning again and consider that they
 do not believe the other to use sufficient higher-order social reasoning
 to go to the office at a specific time.
 But this answer does not refer to this and instead justifies a later canteen
 answer with the true statement that it is still possible for both to get
 the biggest payoff by going to the canteen at later times.
 The reference to intuition possibly means that while their higher-order
 social reasoning entails that going to the canteen is not safe at later
 times, this is counter-intuitive as their intuition does not include this
 complex reasoning.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answers are grouped around positive affirmation again (51% and 57%) rather
 than negative (35% and 36%).
 The positive answers refer to either adjusting their strategy based on
 their partners earlier choices or from learning more about the game.
 One person explicitly states: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes because after a few rounds I realized it is never safe to go canteen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The positive answers from the DTU trial indicated a focus on learning about
 the structure of the game and the impossibility of safely establishing
 canteen coordination compared to the second DTU trial.
 The general dominance of positive answers indicate that participants do
 not rely on backwards induction alone, viewing each round as a one-shot
 game.
 Rather, many took earlier behavior into account, besides also reasoning
 more about the structure of the game.

\begin_layout Subsection
Supplementary discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An essential part of experiments which elicit beliefs from participants
 depend on other implicit assumptions about their beliefs.
 Inferring and understanding why participants might have behaved like the
 did in the canteen dilemma therefore depends on implicit assumptions about
 their understanding of the structure of the game.
 There is as such a few aspects of the results which warrants methodological
 discussion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in both AMT and two DTU trials chose canteen at 8:50 47%, 43%
 and 64% of the time, respectively.
 The rules of the game is intended to entail that participants infer the
 three following propositions: (a) every round you are given an arrival
 time where the other player arrives 10 minutes before or after yourself,
 (b) you have to chose between canteen and office in every round, (c) if
 you arrive at 9:00 or 9:10 you have to go to the office and (d) you have
 to do the same as the other player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does a significant amount of participants chose canteen at 8:50 then?
 It is possible that they understood (a) to (d) above and simply took a
 chance, knowing the other might arrive at 9:00 and knowing that that the
 other would choose the office.
 This explains why it is centered around 50%, as it is interpreted to be
 50/50 what the other player does.
 This is also shown in some strategy answers, see for example the following:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried to play it safe.
 It's obvious to go the canteen anytime before 8:40, but when 8:50 comes
 up it's a gamble.
 I messed up by assuming my partner would agree once, but after that I played
 it safe so I would lose less.

 (AMT strategy answer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 (First DTU trial)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last strategy answer refers to going to the office at 8:50 and 8:40
 as well.
 I argue that going to the office at 8:40 is due to first order reasoning,
 because when the participant assume the other person assume the first went
 to the office, the first is attributing 0-order reasoning to the other,
 that is, reasoning about the world, since where the other player went is
 a behavioral question.
 That is, at 8:40 they represent the others mental state in 8:50, where
 they might believe the situation is (8:50, 9:00) which is a non-mental
 fact which entails an office choice for them.
 But notice that at 8:30, they apply second-order reasoning, as they imagine
 the other arriving at 8:40 and attributes first-order reasoning to them.
 This means that the random choice at 8:50 is moved to 8:30 for this participant
, while earlier arrival times are subsequently ignored.
 The first answer written above even states that it's obvious to go to the
 canteen at earlier times, likely due to lack of higher-order social reasoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that participants chose canteen at 8:50 due to different
 reasons too however.
 They might have interpreted the rules such that they did not infer (c)
 or (d).
 They might have not have inferred (c) and thought they could go to the
 canteen at 9:00, meaning it would be okay to go to the canteen at 8:50
 if the other did the same at 9:00.
 They might have also have ignored (d) and thought that they could go to
 the canteen as long as 
\emph on
they 
\emph default
arrived before 9:00.
 The rules in the AMT and first DTU trial stated 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you arrive before 9:00 am, you have time to go to the canteen, but you
 should only go if your colleague goes to the canteen as well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which can be reasonably interpreted as 8:50 being an acceptable time to
 go to the office.
 While a reasonable interpretation, the rules continue stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you or your colleague arrive at 9:00 am or after, you should go straight
 to your offices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This arguably overrides the previous statement, but since the other statement
 comes first, it is possible it has been prioritized.
 This was tested however in the second DTU trial, where the sentence was
 changed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 arrive before 9:00 am ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where 62% of participants choose canteen at 8:50 (see Appendix B).
 While different populations, it provides some evidence that unintended
 interpretation of the rules lead to canteen choices at 8:50.
 Canteen choices at 8:50 might therefore be understood as gambles, which
 were somewhat calculated as we also see the lowest certainty estimates
 at this arrival time.
 It does pose the problem that those arriving at 8:40 are possibly inclined
 towards the canteen, if they believe that the other person chooses canteen
 at 8:30 for sure and only half the times at 8:50.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also the question why some (circa 15% in the AMT trial) have chosen
 canteen at 9:00 and 9:10 which are zero-order reasoning failures.
 Part of the explanation is random answers, since we would expect some participa
nts to either choose randomly or intentionally choose opposite their preferences
 (trolling).
 This accounts for some of the 15% which also explains some of the around
 7-10% of participants choosing office from 8:00 to 8:30.
 In other words, this might be the level of background noise in the data,
 such that these office choices are not necessarily indicative of reasoning
 either.
 This seems to be supported by the first DTU trial.
 The first DTU trial included students at DTU in a course focused on logic
 during one of their courses.
 The demographic was therefore in setting where they are used to understanding
 and interpreting the logic of statements and complying with them.
 The first DTU trial had 4% and 0% choosing canteen at 9:00 and 9:10 respectivel
y, and 0 percent choosing office at 8:00 and 8:10.
 This means that the DTU students generally had a good a zero-order understandin
g of the structure of the game, which means that such an interpretation
 of the rules is at least possible.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

Another possibility as to why the amount of canteen choices seem high is
 the effect of the framing narrative.
 Participants might rely on their own preferences over those stated in the
 game, implying that they do not really believe that there is any benefit
 of going to the office together before you absolutely have to.
 While they might intuitively understand the preference of going to the
 canteen with their colleague, it might be less intuitive to understand
 why going to the office is only preferable if the other does so as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing from the discussion above, there are a few ways the canteen dilemma
 experiment could have been methodologically improved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the pilot-testing of the canteen dilemma could possibly have been
 improved by including meta-questions.
 This could be general questions about the game, such as whether they were
 able to understand and recall the rules, if they had had enough time in
 the experiment and general comments they might have.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the behavior of participants could have been interpreted more robustly
 by including linguistic controls.
 A linguistic control question would be question that could be answered
 correctly if and only if a person has made a specific interpretation of
 the rules.
 Such a question could ask participants 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should you do if you arrive at 8:50 and you know the other arrives
 at 9:00
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, the general interpretation of the rules could also have been aided
 by re-stating them in a more intuitive story.
 The implicit possibility of going to the office at any time could also
 have been emphasized, or tested for in a linguistic control.
 The rules could for example emphasize a story where two colleagues generally
 want to work on an important project together, which requires both of them
 to handle and which they have to start on at 9:00 at the latest, but also
 possibly earlier.
 This could mean pumping the intuition of always being allowed to work on
 a project together, while not always being allowed to go the canteen, since
 it has some relevant deadline.
 Even though the payoff structure implicitly emphasized the importance of
 avoiding discoordination (more than half of the participants in the AMT
 trial lost their entire bonus due to discoordination), the facilitating
 narrative could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of avoiding
 discoordination.
 Earlier arrival times could also have been left out, putting an emphasis
 on for example third-order social reasoning.
 The participants could also have been given the same arrival times in a
 fixed order with this being common knowledge.
 The game could also be structured differently such that participants were
 automatically assigned to the office at 9:00 and 9:10.
 A more drastic change be that payoff for choosing office was independent
 on the other player while office was not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth, questions after the game could be tailored more narrowly towards
 the falsification of hypotheses, including linguistic controls.
 Some existing questions could simply be altered, for example the question
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imagine you arrive at 8:00 am.
 Is it common knowledge between you and your colleague that it is safe to
 go to the canteen, that is, you both arrived before 9:00 am?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could be changed such that the arrival time in question was randomly generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fifth, the experiment could have had a more narrow focus in terms of the
 possibly different cognitive processes which makes up social cognition.
 Delimiting terminology and focus is of course difficult due to the diffuse
 taxonomy of social cognition.
 The focus of the canteen dilemma could have been delimited by focusing
 either on explicit/reflective social cognition or implicit/spontaneous
 social cognition.
 This could also be testing the degree to which such reasoning could be
 replicated by other cognitive processes which does not involve representation
 of mental states, like 'submentalizing' described by Heyes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes submentalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which she argues could be both a substrate and subsitute for thinking
 about the minds of others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Future research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cognitive capacity of attributing mental states to others have been
 the focus of numerous studies it but it still remains surprisingly enigmatic.
 It has often been described as 'theory of mind' but this term has been
 criticized by researchers like Schaafsma et al, who argue that its meaning
 is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vague and inconsistent, its biological bases are a subject of debate, and
 the methods used to study it are highly heterogeneous
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 65"
key "Schaafsma deconstructing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The cognitive capacity in question is undeniably central to our social
 life however and it is therefore important to understand its complexity.
 Appreciating that others have minds of their own could consist of a conglomerat
e of implicit and explicit cognitive processes, some which might relate
 more to behavior than mental states.
 This calls for research of the possibly unexplored diversity of processes
 and aspects of social cognition, including subsequently improved terminology,
 which would aid numerous research fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cognitive science and psychology could benefit in terms of improving our
 understanding of both cognitive development in children as well as the
 fully fledged capacities and limitations of adults.
 By getting a more accurate description of how adults infer representational
 mental states of others, logic and computer science could make more realistic
 computational models of human reasoning.
 If artificially intelligent agents are to understand and predict human
 reasoning, including prediction of how their own action might be perceived
 by humans, it is important that they have an idea of how humans might reason
 and not just how they might ought to reason.
 As Heyes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes submentalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, some cases where mentalizing is inferred might better be understood
 as sub-mentalizing, that is, domain-general cognitive mechanisms which
 simulate mentalizing in social contexts.
 This is a somewhat behaviorist point which implicitly states that supposed
 reasoning about mental states does in fact not refer to mental states at
 all.
 This supports Erb 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Erb - AI and ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who argues that humans might very well start assigning intentions, beliefs
 and motives to non-human counterparts and as these thoughts becomes part
 of the interaction between humans and ambient technology like self-driving
 cars, the details and intricacies involved must be considered carefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the central role which intentions, beliefs and mental states have
 in philosophy, developing a nuanced understanding of social cognition has
 beneficial to philosophy as well, from epistemology, philosophy of mind,
 ethics and logic.
 While social cognition by its nature ignores old philosophical problems
 like solipsism, it can have immense importance in relation to modern problems.
 Agent-centered deontological moral theory states for example that actions
 are permissibly depending on the intentions of the agent, but this means
 that any moral evaluation of the actions of others depends the capacity
 to understand the intentions of others.
 This is a way in which insights from social cognition can moral problems
 in an epistemological light.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The canteen dilemma added to the possible diversity of this cognitive capacity,
 as it indicates that there might variation even among just 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order of social reasoning.
 A possible avenue for future research would be to map some of these details,
 for example testing if and under what circumstance some first-order reasoners
 might be closer to second-order reasoning than others.
 Empirical nuance also makes it easier to establish a scientifically tractable
 terminology for accurately describing this interesting cognitive phenomena.
 While the term 'theory of mind' is arguably sometimes used vaguely, it
 is understandingly difficult for researchers to use better terms for a
 concept if its complexity is not yet sufficiently explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis presented and introduced a large and still developing research
 field related to the study of social reasoning.
 It revolved around the cognitive capacity to mentally represent possible
 mental states of others, such as beliefs, desires or intentions.
 This included a critical discussion of the heterogeneity of terms and methods
 used to study this capacity.
 I also discussed the importance of researching actual cognitive capacities
 even in relation to logic and computational models for reasoning in computer
 science, often thought to be normative in nature and independent of how
 humans actually reason.
 This works as an introduction to the accompanying article on the canteen
 dilemma experiment conducted at the Center for Information and Bubble Studies
 (CIBS).
 I argued that this experiment indicated further diversity in the capacity
 to reason about the mental states of others.
 Results indicated that even within those who only have the capacity for
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning, some might be closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 than others.
 This implies some type of continuity in the various degrees of higher order
 social reasoning, which in turn might aid in understanding the developmental
 aspect of social cognition.
 This development aspect can either be understood genetically, as children
 developing this capacity as they grow up, or culturally, as adults acquire
 higher orders of social reasoning through cultural evolution.
