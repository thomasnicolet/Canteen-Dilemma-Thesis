\begin_layout Abstract
It is often necessary to attribute appropriate mental states to others in
 order to be able to interpret and predict their behavior.
 The cognitive capacity to do so have often been referred to as 'theory
 of mind'.
 Although interpreting the behavior of others in terms of mental traits
 seems to occur naturally, the reasoning involved is notoriously difficult.
 The present thesis involves an experiment called the canteen dilemma aimed
 at investigating the limits of this capacity.
 The experiment was devised and implemented in conjunction with R.
 Engelhardt (CIBS) and T.
 Bolander (DTU Computer).
 The present paper is an introduction to an accompanying article on the
 experiment.
 It presents empirical findings from cognitive science which are relevant
 for understanding the canteen dilemma as well as motivate its importance
 and relation to logic and other fields.
 I motivate interdisciplinary work between logic and cognitive science by
 arguing that empirical insights are necessary in order for logic to make
 psychologically realistic models of agents, which benefits both cognitive
 science by providing insights into the computational complexity involved
 in human reasoning as well as allowing artificial intelligent technology
 to behave more human-like.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Making sense of observed behavior of others in terms of unobservable mental
 traits is cognitive capacity essential for successful social interaction.
 Inferring what others might think, believe or intend helpsus navigate our
 complex social world.
 This sociocognitive capacity allows us to not just predict and understand
 the behavior of others based on their mental states, but also predict and
 understand how our behavior might affect the mental states of others.
 It is this capacity which allow self-aware humans to acknowledge and appreciate
 that others have mental states just like themselves.
 It has understandably been described as the pinnacle of social cognition
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The capacity was originally referred to as 'theory of mind' in the seminal
 paper by Premack & Woodruff 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Premack & Woodruff"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in 1978.
 It has seen implicit philosophical attention for centuries and been of
 immense scientific interest in the last 40 years within studies such as
 psychology, biology, neuroscience and philosophy.
 This thesis consists of two parts: An article on an experiment, called
 the canteen dilemma, which aims at investigating the nature and limited
 use of theory of mind, as well as the present paper which works as an introduct
ion to the article.
 The canteen dilemma experiment was conducted at the Center for Information
 and Bubble studies and was designed and implemented in conjunction with
 R.
 Engelhardt and T.
 Bolander.
 The experiment consists of a two-player strategic coordination game with
 imperfect information with a structure such that one's social reasoning
 affects one's behavior in the game.
 The present introduction is intended to supplement the accompanying article
 by presenting and discussing relevant research on social cognition, how
 and why it is relevant to research in logic, as well as providing supplementary
 results and discussion on the canteen dilemma experiment itself.

It is necessary to preface some of the discussion on social cognition with
 some reservations.
 The field has been criticized in terms of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theory of mind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being used vaguely and inconsistently between studies and by reference
 to studies (i) treating theory of mind as a monolithic process, (ii) referring
 to a single brain network for theory of mind and (iii) conflating varieties
 of theory of mind 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 It has also been argued that certain studies which point to cases of theory
 of mind could be explained without reference to mental states 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This calls for a critical assessment of the scientific understanding of
 theory of mind which will be discussed later in section

 Attributing mental states to others have also been referred to as 'mentalizing'

 Given that the canteen dilemma's emphasis on reasoning about possible mental
 states of others in order to inform one's decisions, I will often use the
 term higher-order social reasoning or cognition, including the term 'social'
 to emphasize interpersonal aspect involved.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite methodological difficulties, the ability to attribute mental states
 to others is undeniably both real and important.
 This ability allows us to develop a more complete and accurate understanding
 of those around us and as such is an essential part of understanding what
 it means to be human.
 The reasoning involved can be applied recursively, modeling the mental
 state of others, including their model of one's own mental state, and so
 on.
 The recursive modeling of the mental states of others is referred to as
 higher-order social reasoning or cognition and it is this cognitive activity
 that is the general focus of the canteen dilemma experiment and this thesis.

\begin_layout Standard
Epistemic logic, the modal logic of knowledge, is a logical language capable
 of representing the knowledge of agents in complex situations and as such
 is a natural tool for describing higher-order social reasoning.
 In general, zero-order reasoning concerns facts about the world, while
 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-order reason concerns facts about 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order reasoning of other people

\end_inset

.
 Since higher order social reasoning can be described in various epistemic
 logics, the interface between logic and cognitive science has recently
 received interest.
 There is a two-fold question in this interdisciplinary field: To what extent
 do people reason differently from logical prescriptions and how do we interpret
 possible divergence in the two areas of research? The first question will
 be discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\end_inset

 while the latter question will be discussed in the section below.
 After the following section I present the epistemic logic 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

 before I turn to relevant empirical insights from cognitive science, focusing
 on the possible limits of human reasoning.
 This leads to a description of the canteen dilemma.
 As the essential details and results of the experiment are fleshed out
 in the accompanying article, this introduction will keep to discussion
 of supplementary results and analysis of the experiment.

\begin_layout Subsection
The cognitive turn in logic 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Logic-and-the"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic bears a long but intricate relation to human reasoning.
 The logic of argumentation has been studied since antiquity and is still
 frequently taught to first year philosophy students.
 The goal of this is presumably not just to teach students about valid inference
s but also to improve the validity of inferences they make themselves.
 Modern logic has besides this traditionally been seen as unrelated to empirical
 facts about human reasoning except as a normative force of how we ought
 to make inferences.
 Modern logic has been undergoing a cognitive turn in recent years which
 has emphasized its relation to human reasoning, notably championed by logicians
 such as Johan van Benthem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "benthem facts matter"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Rineke Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

This cognitive turn is a step away from the anti-psychologism exhibited
 in the early days of modern logic, as Frege stated that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logic is concerned .
 .
 .
 not with the question of how people think, but with the question of how
 they must think if they are not to miss the truth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 250"
key "frege1897"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Frege refers to the normativity of logic but his point rests on a more
 fundamental claim that logic is the study of objective mind-independent
 logical laws, which he states explicitly: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the laws of truth are not psychological laws: they are boundary stones set
 in an eternal foundation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 13"
key "frege 1964"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 So logic is normative according to Frege because the norms for reasoning
 and beliefs are structured by what is truth-conducing and the laws of logic
 are objective truths, in fact necessary truths.
 Andersen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "neo-kantianism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues that Husserl followed Frege in this anti-psychologism as Husserl
 even argued that any argument that makes logic independent from psychology
 by reference to the distinction between how we ought to think and how do
 do think is implicitly psychologistic, since any such argument still refers
 to human reasoning (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "§17-20"
key "Husserl"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 So for Frege and Husserl, the normativity of logic is a side-effect of
 its objectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectivity of logic has been part of a fundamental philosophical debate
 about what makes logical truths true, what logical facts are about and
 whether they are necessarily or contingently true.
 There is a rich historical dialogue on this from Frege, Husserl, Wittgenstein,
 Ayer, Carnap, Quine, Kripke and Putnam among others, although its discussion
 is only indirectly related to how the purity of logic relates to the quirks
 of human reasoning.
 Assume we reject Frege's view and adopt a non-Platonistic Realism like
 Maddy  
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "maddy phil of logic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or even more radical empirical version from Quine 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Quine"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which states that the truth of logical laws are contingent on the right
 physical structuring.
 This does not affect the normativity of logic because even on such a view,
 human reasoning takes place within the physical structuring in question
 and is governed by the laws of logic as well.
 How is human reasoning relevant for logic then?
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take argumentative logic.
 There are certain inferences that humans make that can only be described
 as mistakes.
 Take Modus Ponens for example, from 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P\rightarrow Q$
\end_inset

, we can conclude 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, which can easily be relevant in situations where failing to infer 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 can have adverse consequences.
 But there are more complex cases which can be modeled by more complex logics
 and where deviance from the logical model might not be a mistake in reasoning.
 There are few reasons for this which both encourage collaboration between
 logic and cognitive science.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, if someone makes an inference which is invalid in classical logic,
 it does not follow that it is logically invalid in non-classical logics.
 There might be good reason for human reasoning does not always follow prescript
ions from classical logic, such as when dealing with incomplete information
 or limited cognitive resources.
 See Drew & Doyle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nonmonotonic logic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Brewka 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "default reasoning"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for work on non-monotonic logic and default reasoning.
 Non-monotonic logic allows valid inferences on incomplete information for
 example such that new information might invalidate earlier inferences,
 which is not possible in classical logic.
 So, it does not follow that reasoning which deviates from some logical
 prescriptions is random or illogical.
 Such reasoning might simply not be properly formalized or represented.
 People might reason differently for various reasons and if logic wants
 to maintain its normativity, it should take these different reasoning patterns
 seriously.

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the problem of developing artificial intelligence was first described
 as that of “making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent
 if a human were so behaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by John McCarthy in 1956 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 11"
key "mccarthy ai"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If we want machines to be able to reason similarly to humans, it is necessary
 to be know the logical structure of how humans actually reason.
 This is especially important when it comes to higher-order social cognition.
 If we want to be able to interact intelligently with artificial agents,
 such agents will have to be able to reason about and understand the reasoning
 of humans.
 In other words, if human reasoning deviates systematically from idealized
 logical prescriptions, AI systems should taking this into account when
 having to predict the behavior of humans.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

I will now turn to epistemic logic as an example of an idealized representation
 of reasoning about knowledge.
 Epistemic logic was originally used to formalize and analyze epistemological
 notions and concepts and is also useful as a tool for showing the epistemic
 depth of certain real world situations.
 Some relevant idealizations will be discussed before moving onto real higher-or
der social reasoning.

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the real situation is Anne being told 2 and Bill 3, denoted as a
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

.
 There are a few basic facts which are true in 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

.
 Most basically, Anne knows her number is 2 and Bill knows his number is
 3: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}a_{2}\land K_{b}b_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Since they know their numbers are consecutive, they both know that there
 are only two possible numbers for the other (but these are not the same
 for Anne and Bill!): 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(b_{1}\lor b_{3})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}(a_{2}\lor a_{4})$
\end_inset

.
 Since Anne considers it possible that Bill has as 1 or 3, she considers
 it possible that Bill considers 0 or 2 possible for Anne (if Bill has 1)
 or 2 or 4 (if Bill has 3), stated as: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(K_{b}(a_{0}\lor a_{2})\lor(K_{b}(a_{2}\lor a_{2}))$
\end_inset

.
 Now imagine that Anne and Bill has to guess whether they both have positive
 numbers, that is, none of them have a 0, denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $(positive)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we ask Anne and Bill in state 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

 if they know that the other's number is positive, they would both answer
 yes: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(positive)\land K_{b}(positive)$
\end_inset

 or expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
 This is equivalent to checking for each agent 
\emph on
i 
\emph default
whether every world which is
\emph on
 i
\emph default
-accessible from 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

 only has positive numbers.
 However, now imagine that we ask both Anne and Bill if they both know that
 
\begin_inset Formula $(positive)$
\end_inset

 is true.
 Bill considers 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(4,3)$
\end_inset

 possible.
 Since we are only focused on 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, we can focus on the lowest number-pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

, since the other direction only takes us away from 0.
 Bill knows Anne's lowest possible number is 2 , which means he knows both
 numbers are positive.
 Since if Anne has a 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, she would consider 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 as the lowest number, Bill knows that Anne knows both numbers are positive
 as well: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}K_{a}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
 But even though Anne in fact has a 2, meaning she knows that both numbers
 are positive since the lowest possible number for Bill would be 1, if Bill
 has a 1, he considers it possible that Anne as a 0.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot K_{a}K_{b}(positive).$
\end_inset

 In other words, while everyone knows that no one has a 0, not everyone
 knows this epistemic fact itself: 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)\land\lnot E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(positive)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The unintuitive aspect of this is the satisfaction of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 iterations of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 operator but not 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 So in the consecutive number example, no matter what number pair Anne and
 Bill are given, it is never common knowledge that none of them have a 0!
 This also means that telling Anne and Bill that both of their numbers are
 positive is actually an informative statement in any possible situation
 of the consecutive numbers example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practical implications of this can be seen by 'gamifying' the example.
 Imagine Anne and Bill have to answer independently of each other whether
 they are certain that both have positive numbers or remain agnostic.
 Their objective is to (1) always give the same answer and (2) not answering
 they have positive numbers if they do not.
 In our supposed case 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

, both agents know they both have positive numbers.
 But as established above, Anne does not know that Bill knows.
 So Anne might remain agnostic and since Bill knows that Anne might have
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, suppose he chooses to do the same.
 This line of reasoning generalizes to any natural number pair in the consecutiv
e number game just devised.
 The reasoning becomes less intuitive as the numbers go up, since it depend
 on increasing orders of social reasoning.
 For example if two real people were given 
\begin_inset Formula $719$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $720$
\end_inset

 in a structure as above and asked the same question, they would probably
 agree that they are certain about it.
 In fact, they might be hard to dissuade otherwise because remaining agnostic
 relies on higher-order social reasoning out of cognitive reach for normal
 people.
 Reasoning about the possible number of the other depends on zero-order
 reasoning, while reasoning about what numbers the other considers possible
 is first-order, and so on as iterations continue.
 As we will see in a few sections, adults are often said to be limited to
 second-order reasoning at most, implying that while Anne and Bill would
 remain agnostic in state 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,3)$
\end_inset

, they might answer differently in 
\begin_inset Formula $(3,4)$
\end_inset

, since Anne would remain agnostic due to second-order reasoning, while
 Bill would not since it would rely on third-order reasoning.
 The next section focuses on some of the details of the limitation on social
 cognition.

Since the term 'theory of mind' have been used in various different ways,
 some conceptual clarification is in order.
 As mentioned above, the term sometimes conflates varieties of cognitive

 of others have also been called various different terms.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 since equilibrium models of game theory depend on higher order beliefs,
 while other fields often focus more on mental terms.
 Some researchers like Schaafsma et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have called for a reformulation of the term 'theory of mind' due to its
 heterogeneous usage.
 This includes deconstructing it into basic processes before reconstructing
 a scientifically tractable concept of theory of mind.
 While a proper reconstruction of the theory of mind concept is outside
 the scope of this thesis, it is necessary to understand some of the heterogenei

 Bloom & German 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bloom and germany abandon false belief"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 also present two reasons why the standard false belief task is not suitable
 for testing theory of mind.
 First, passing the false belief task requires other cognitive capacities
 than just a theory of mind, like general task demands, which causes young
 children to fail regardless of any theory of mind.
 Second, having a theory of mind involves more than the ability to reason
 about false beliefs.
 That is, even though children younger than 2 years fail the false belief
 task, studies show that they can still appreciate some of the mental states
 of others, like attributing goals to others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Csibra"

.
 So besides the different terminology used, the capacity of attributing
 mental states to others is possible a complex made up of various cognitive
 processes, which would plausibly explain the heterogeneity of the methods
 used to test it.

 The Wason selection task

 In Wason's study, subjects were shown sixteen cards with a letter on one
 side and a number on the other.
 Four of these, D, K, 3 and 7 were used.
 Subjects were then asked which cards to turn in order to evaluate whether
 the following claim was true:

 The correct cards to turn are those with

While this shows that there might be a non-deficiency explanation even when
 people seem to fail to make correct inferences in propositional logic,
 the fact still stands that people of course do not always reason perfectly.
 However traditional propositional logic often sets a standard that is low
 enough that it can be met at least in specialized settings where there
 is a special requirement to avoid logical failures.
 So propositional logic might not be overly idealized when it comes to arguments
 (ignoring the fact that propositional logic does not capture the dynamic
 and rhetorical aspects of real arguments).
 It is another story when it comes to higher order social reasoning.
 Before I go into empirical results on higher order social reasoning, let
 us look at some of the overly idealized aspects of

 To see this, note that real knowledge is gathered in a dynamic social environme
nt, where agents update and change their knowledge and beliefs as they gain
 new information.
 There are many aspects of the social dynamics of knowledge which are outside
 the scope of this thesis, but some of this dynamic can be expressed by
 our epistemic logic by adding action expressions as well as dynamic modalities
 for these.
 This means adding the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $[!\varphi]\varphi$

, with the truth condition:

It is often mentioned that public announcement of an atomic fact makes it
 common knowledge, while the same is not always the case for epistemic facts.
 Statements like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Moore-type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentences which leads to unsuccessful updates.
 But when announcing non-epistemic propositions, agents 
\emph on
ought
\emph default
 to come to know it.
 This rests however on the idealized presupposition that agents have perfect
 observation, since the announcement and its contents must be clearly understood
 by all, and perfect recall, since agents must be able to remember all of
 this as time passes.
 In fact, for an announcement to become common knowledge, perfect observation
 and recall must be common knowledge among agents as well.
 Publicly announcing non-epistemic facts to real people do not always bring
 about common knowledge about such facts.
 Statements can either be too complex or lengthy for agents to decipher,
 or the statements might be ambiguous, as some researchers argue in the
 Wason selection task.
 In other words, if the mistakes in the Wason selection has to be put in
 terms of cognitive limits, they might not indicate a limit in computational
 power but rather a limit in observational power.
 As we will see later, limitations in terms of social cognition does not
 seem to occur due to limited zero-order reasoning, it is rather some barrier
 to the modal depth of formulas agents can come to know.

 limitations as found in Liu

Parameters (a) to (d) can be understood as logical norms describing the
 limits of truth-conducing capacities.
 That is, even if no one is perfect, each parameter is a way in which agents
 could be epistemically better off.
 This is difficult to see with (e) however, where the optimal case is not
 clear, since neither complete epistemic conservatism or revisionism seems
 rational.
 As Liu writes, it might be better to move away from understanding deviations
 from such norms purely negatively as 'limits' or 'bounds' on cognitive
 capacity, and instead see them positively as the different resources that
 agents have and use to successfully accomplish difficult tasks.
 After all, the story of humanity is largely a success story dependent on
 our cognitive prowess, even if so limited.
 As Benthem mentions, paraphrasing Joerg Siekmann, the most admirable in
 a mathematics seminar is not presenting a well-oiled proof, it is rather
 the ability to discover a mistake and recover on the spot.
 Rationality on this view is owed to learning from one's mistakes, and as
 Benthem points out, the dynamic behavior involved in this surely depends
 on more mechanisms than just inferences.
 This is just to present an alternative picture of discussion on cognitive
 limitations which are not simply deficit-based.

 in adults, I will briefly motivate why it is important to understand such
 sociocognitive limitations.
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\begin_layout Standard
Before moving onto specific limitations, it is important to note why such
 limitations are relevant.
 Having an insight into the mental workings of others play a vital role
 in both social interaction and basic human functions such as having empathy
 towards others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "empathy 1,Empathy2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 There two other general reasons why it is important to map apparent limitations
 of this vital mental capacity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we can only hope to counteract and adjust for possible cognitive
 shortcomings if we become aware of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, even when higher-order reasoning deviates from certain logical prescript
ions it is not necessarily a logical mistake in the sense that the reasoning
 might simply fits some other logical framework.
 People interact and cooperate successfully with others all the time, so
 if social reasoning is limited, there must be other heuristics that take
 over.
 Finding out how reasoning is limited relative to logical frameworks makes
 it possible to figure out what such alternative heuristics might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, ambient technology such as self-driving cars have to understand
 and predict human actions, and as such have to reason about how humans
 might reason.
 Such artificial agents would be wrong to assume that humans reasons like
 themselves.
 In fact, as Benjamin Erb 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Erb - AI and ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, when optimizing intelligent human-computer interaction it is important
 that both humans and their non-human counterparts can reason about the
 'mental' states of each other.
 That is, for non-human agents to successfully predict and reason about
 the behavior of humans, they will have to simulate human beliefs and the
 usefulness of such a simulation hinges on how accurately the it represents
 the actual mental state of the human in question.
 Since the only salient factor here is accuracy of representation, questions
 of normativity can be ignored.
 This also holds the other way around, as Erb writes: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In intelligent, technical environments, humans may intrinsically apply ToM
 traits to their non-human interaction partners
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Humans may in other words also attribute a 'mental' model to non-human
 interaction partners concerning the reasoning and intentions behind their
 actions.
 This leads to some of various limitations of human social cognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The difficulty of reading minds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different ways in which human cognition seems to be limited
 in terms of higher order social reasoning.
 It is limited in the sense that it is seemingly capped at first or second-order
 reasoning.
 Studies show that most adults in game-like settings can utilize first-order
 reasoning and do a good attempt at second-order reasoning, while having
 a higher order theory of mind is rare 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Flobbeverbrugge etc 2008,hedden2002,Verbrugge 2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 There are signs of more severe limitations however, indicating that social
 reasoning is either entirely absent or otherwise incomplete in ways which
 are not encapsulated by simply being restricted to a certain order of social
 reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spontaneous versus reflective use of theory of mind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental studies show that there is a relevant difference between having
 a capacity to correctly attribute mental states to others and actually
 using this in practice.
 Keysar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that there is a stark dissociation between having the ability to
 reflectively distinguish one's beliefs from others and the routine deployment
 of this ability in interpreting the actions of others.
 Their findings imply that even adults who are capable of forming reasonable
 beliefs about the beliefs of others do not consult this crucial knowledge
 when interpreting the actions of others.
 Their claim is specific to the capacity of representing beliefs of others
 separately from corresponding reality, that is, acknowledging that others
 might have false beliefs.
 It suggests a difference between relying on one's theory of mind in reflective
 tasks and utilizing as a decision-guiding mechanism.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Curse of Knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Birch & Bloom 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bloom"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 show that adults who have to attribute beliefs to others have a tendency
 to attribute their own belief instead of correctly attributing a false
 belief.
 They write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adult's own knowledge of an event's outcome can compromise their ability
 to reason about another person's beliefs about that event
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 College aged adults were told a story where a girl Vicky puts her violin
 in a blue container.
 While Vicky is outside, her sister Denise puts the violin in a different
 container, depending on the treatment, either (Ignorance) simply in another
 container, (plausible knowledge) moves violin to the red container or (implausi
ble knowledge) moves the violin to the purple container.
 The plausibly and implausible condition relates to the red container being
 violin shaped, while the purple container being an odd shape for a violin.
 When subjects did not know where the violin had been moved, they where
 generally good at predicting that Vicky would look for her violin in the
 blue container.
 When the violin was moved to either the purple or the red container, participan
ts assigned significantly higher probabilities to Vicky looking in the purple
 or the red container respectively (even though Vicky would still believe
 it was in the blue container).
 Participants also assigned higher probabilities to the treatment with the
 red (plausible) container than with the blue (implausible) one.
 That is, participants relied on their own beliefs when attributing beliefs
 to Vicky, and this erroneous first-order social reasoning was strengthened
 by feeling more justified in their belief.
 The authors call this the the curse of knowledge and is related to the
 problem in Keysar et al.
 as well.
 Both show that theory of mind use might be task dependent, which we will
 look at now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Task dependence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations described above suggest that successful application of theory
 of mind can be task-dependent, successfully applied in some contexts but
 not in others.
 Understanding why this ability might be task dependent can lead to better
 understanding the nature of higher order social cognition.
 Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 lists a few possible explanations.
 First, there might be a high processing cost associated with theory of
 mind, causing a failure in applying appropriate order of social reasoning
 when the the processing cost becomes too high.
 Second, the capacity for performing higher order social reasoning does
 not necessarily transfer between domains.
 Being apple to apply this cognitive capacity across domains might require
 a development process like Representational Redescription to take place
 as suggested by Karmiloff-Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Karmiloff"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, in order to utilize a higher order theory of mind in a situation,
 it is not just necessary to possess this capacity, but also to recognize
 that it is advantageous to incorporate this knowledge into actions, decisions
 or interpretation of the actions of others.
 This is in line with the explanation that applying higher order social
 reasoning has a high processing cost.
 In other words, due to the high processing cost of applying it, it might
 simply not be worth the effort to rely on it per default, so it might largely
 be ignored until its importance becomes sufficiently apparent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is further supported by an argument in Keysar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keysar 2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as to why adults do not always deploy their existing theory of mind.
 They mention that in the real word, perspectives often tend to coincide.
 This means that a lot of knowledge important for social interaction is
 common knowledge, which reinforces the point above that differentiating
 between one's beliefs and the beliefs of others might unnecessarily take
 up cognitive resources.
 As Keysar et al.
 mentions, the dynamic nature of face-to-face interactions give people a
 feedback mechanism which allows them to be egocentric by effectively distributi
ng the burden of applying appropriate order social reasoning across interlocutor
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, theory of mind might not be a uniform of social cognition at all.
 Without taking a complete behaviorist stance, one might even question to
 what extend theory of mind relates to mental states at all.
 It is possible that when researchers deduce implicit social reasoning,
 it might just be learned behavior.
 For example when a person hears a cyclist ring their bell they likely infer
 an intention behind the action, that the person doing it is impatient.
 But this is could perhaps be explained by simple learned behavior.
 It is also likely inferred so spontaneously that it does not seem right
 to say that people hear the sound and then reason about what it might mean.
 In phenomenological terms, the ringing of the bell might 
\emph on
sound
\emph default
 like someone is trying to get a reaction from you, which prompts the reaction
 without much explicit consideration of underlying mental states.
 If social reasoning is computationally 'expensive', this could explain
 how it can appear so extensively in everyday interaction, but also why
 it is difficult in more complex situations, since people might rarely be
 aware of the explicit use of their higher order theory of mind.

This concludes the introduction to different logical and empirical aspects
 of higher order social cognition which underlies the canteen dilemma.
 Logical prescriptions often help us navigating how humans ought to reason,
 but as we have seen, in order to make prescriptive norms for higher order
 social reasoning, it is necessary to look at the actual reasoning done
 by real people.
 This leads us to the canteen dilemma, an experiment on coordination with
 imperfect information which involve exactly this type of reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Canteen Dilemma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canteen dilemma was devised by Thomas Bolander and designed and implemented
 in conjunction with Robin Engelhardt and myself.
 The game has structural affinity to the consecutive number example in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Consecutive-numbers-example "
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 It likewise depicts a situation where two agents have mutual knowledge
 about something iterated several times (everyone knows that, everyone knows
 that ...) while never having common knowledge (everyone knows that, everyone
 knows that ...
 infinitely iterated).
 The structure is framed in a thematic story since studies show that this
 can significantly improve people's zero-order logical reasoning abilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meijering,wason 1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and this reasoning is not the focus of the canteen dilemma.
 The story is the following: Each player is told that they and their colleague
 arrive for work every morning between 8:00 am and 9:10 am.
 They always arrive 10 minutes apart but only know their own arrival time.
 The task for the players is to coordinate their decisions, while knowing
 that both have to go to the office if they arrive at 9:00 or later.
 Their preferences are ordered such that their prefer (1) going to the canteen
 together if both arrive before 9:00, (2) going to the office together at
 any time and (3) all other configurations, that is, discoordinating or
 either player going to the canteen at 9:00 or later.
 The game consists of a number of rounds where each player are assigned
 an arrival time and have to decide between going to the canteen or the
 office.
 The payoff structure follows a logarithmic scoring rule, meaning participants
 gave an estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of how certain they were that they made the right choice, implicitly assigning
 
\begin_inset Formula $100-p$
\end_inset

 to being wrong.
 Research on eliciting belief have shown that forecasts from observers through
 proper scoring rules are significantly more accurate and calibrated

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rules dictate that players prefer going to the canteen if they both
 arrive before 9:00, but that they should always go to the office if they
 or their colleague arrives at 9:00 or 9:10.
 Take the following example to see some of the complexity of the game.
 Assume player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:50.
 Player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
know that 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40 or 9:00.
 If 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 9:00, 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 should go to the office.
 If
\emph on
 b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40, they would prefer going to the canteen together.
 Player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
knows they prefer going to the canteen but since one of the possible scenarios
 would require her to go to the office assume player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
chooses the office at 8:50.
 Now assume 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 arrives at 8:40 instead and reasons the following way.
 If 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
arrives at 8:50 am and reasons like 
\emph on
a, 
\emph default
player 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 they would go to the office at 8:50 as well, in which case 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
might go to the office at 8:40 just like they did at 8:50.
 This line of reasoning follows for all possible arrival times by backwards
 induction, and so 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
might never choose to go to the canteen! 
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that a player who arrives at 8:40 knows that the other arrived at
 8:50 at the latest and that it is therefore preferable for both to go to
 the canteen.
 However, players do not just have to consider the possible arrival times,
 they also have to consider what others might do in such circumstances.
 In order to predict the choice the other player might make in their situation,
 the first player has to consider what the other player considers possible,
 which is different from their own point of view.
 That is, the player who arrives at 8:40 has to appreciate the fact that
 while she knows that both would prefer going to the canteen, the other
 player does not know this.
 So making an office choice at 8:40 or earlier requires a player to not
 just consider facts about the world, that is, if both arrived before 9:00
 or not, but also consider what the other player would do in this situation,
 which depends on the beliefs of the other player.
 This means that predicting an office choice at 8:40 or earlier relies on
 higher order social reasoning.
 Of course, players can always choose office for whatever reason, for example
 if they just make random choices.
 But we would expect this to be both evenly distributed among both canteen
 and office choices as well as across arrival times.
 This means that the relative difference can still be indicative of reasoning
 of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice however the premise above that for 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 to go to the office at 8:40, she has to consider how 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
reasons if she arrived at 8:50.
 It means that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
assumes 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to reason like herself
\emph on
.
 
\emph default
So this example does not just assume that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
performs first-order social reasoning but also that she believes 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to correctly apply zero-order reasoning to reach a specific conclusion.
 So it does not just rely on players reasoning a specific way but also that
 it is common knowledge among players that they reason a specific way.
 This means that regardless of what player 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
thinks 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
ought to do, 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
has to try and to figure out what 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
will actually do.
 It implies that without common knowledge about rationality, two rational
 players cannot be expected to play rationally.
 They might both choose canteen because they do not believe the other to
 apply the sufficient order of social reasoning, or that the other believes
 that they do and so on.
 While office choices arguably does signify social reasoning, choosing canteen
 does therefore not signify a lack of it.
 To summarize, I postulate towo conditionals: 
\series bold
(1) 
\series default
If a participant chooses office at 8:40 or earlier, they rely on higher-order
 social reasoning and (2) if a participant only uses zero-order reasoning,
 they will choose canteen at 8:40 and earlier, office at 9:00 and later
 and 8:50 being a toss up.
 I argue that choosing office at 8:50 does not necessarily rely on first-order
 social reasoning, since it is a fact about the world stated in the rules
 that the other might arrive at 9:00 and that you should choose office in
 that case.
 The converse conditionals are not taken to be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The certainty estimates involved can be valuable to get further information
 here.
 Assume a rational player plays the game and arrives at 8:40.
 They might infer that the optimal choice would be going to the office by
 relying on higher order social reasoning, assuming the other thinks the
 same way.
 But if they are uncertain about what type of reasoner the other player
 is, they might believe that the other player might play canteen and they
 can therefore hedge their decision by being less certain.
 So the certainty estimates helps offset some of the loss of possible discoordin
ation if it can be predicted.
 This makes it possible to distinguish between players who all choose canteen
 at a given arrival time, since those who assign a lower certainty estimate
 to it than others implicitly assign a higher chance to office and therefore
 make use of higher-order of social reasoning per (1) above.
 This also help deflect what Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "verbrugge logic and social cognition"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 calls the danger of simplistic formal systems which posit fixed bounds
 on social cognition, that is, assuming that people can reason up to 
\emph on
n 
\emph default
order but not 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 
\emph default
This will also be the focus when viewing the results later, since it shows
 that natural social cognition might be more continuous than previously
 described.
 Before looking into the results, I will now go through some of the logical
 structure of the game in terms of epistemic logic.
 This is followed by supplementary discussion and results of the canteen
 dilemma not included in the accompanying article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 Let us first abbreviate the proposition that

both players arrived before 9:00
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(early)$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 Recall that the highest possible payoff is both players choosing canteen,
 but only if 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(early)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
is true.
 The proposition is true in any state where 9:00 or 9:10 does not occur,
 so any but the four right-most states in 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now suppose the actual situation is 
\begin_inset Formula $(\text{8:30, 8:40)}$
\end_inset

 where
\emph on
 a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:30 and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
at 8:40.
 Since the proposition 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(early)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
is true in every state which either 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
considers possible (connected to, in terms of the graph), they both know
 that they both arrived before 9:00 and that going to the canteen would
 be their preferred choice.
 This epistemic fact is not known by both agents however, since 
\emph on

\emph default
consider it possible that she is in 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{(8:50, 8:40)}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We can now show the structure of the canteen dilemma by relying on logical
 tools rather than joggling multiple iterations of knowledge.
 A player might think that it is not just necessary for 
\emph on
early 
\emph default
to be true in order to make a canteen choice, they must know that it is
 true.
 This excludes the four right-most states in 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

 as mentioned above.
 But since players in the canteen dilemma have to coordinate their actions,
 they have to consider how the other player might act, which requires reasoning
 about their beliefs.
 When 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:40 then, she knows both players arrived before 9:00, but she
 does not know that 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
knows.
 If it is necessary for 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
to know (
\emph on
early
\emph default
) in order to go the canteen, then 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
considers it possible that 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
does not go to the canteen.
 If we couple this with the assumption that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
does not want to go to the canteen if the other player might not make the
 same choice, then 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
will not go to the canteen at 8:40 either due to reasoning about what the
 other knows about their situation.
 This line of reasoning can be iterated for any earlier arrival time, implying
 that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
will never go to the canteen.
 This is unintuitive however.
 Take for example state (8:00, 8:10) where everyone knows that everyone
 knows that everyone knows that everyone knows that it is early enough to
 go to the canteen.

Notice how unfit ordinary language is for portraying higher-order reasoning.
 Since our understanding of the is structured by language, it is possible
 that the limitations of ordinary language also play a role in limited higher-or
der reasoning.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 That is four iterations of mutual knowledge: 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(early)$
\end_inset

.
 But it is not true for five iterations, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(early)$
\end_inset

 is also true in that state.
 So it is not common knowledge that it is early enough to go to the canteen
 and there is in fact no such time where 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(early)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
is common knowledge.
 This can be re-stated by saying that while choosing canteen at 8:50 involves
 a risk of discoordination, it is impossible to avoid any risk no matter
 how early you put the canteen choice.
 This nuance is hard to accept due to cognitive limits on our capacity for
 higher-order social reasoning.
 The infinitary modal depth is therefore another cognitively unrealistic
 idealizations of 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

.
 The next section will present a case study of how epistemic logic might
 deal with this specific limitation.

\begin_layout Standard
Ditmarsch & Labuschagne 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 have proposed a logical framework capable of modeling various types of
 beliefs agents may have about the beliefs of others.
 This is done by modeling degrees of belief by partially ordered preference
 relations.
 Preference relations are motivated by the fact that without them, all epistemic
 alternatives in an 
\begin_inset Formula $S5$
\end_inset

 model are deemed equally possible.
 So instead of treating all accessibility relations between states equally,
 it becomes a preference ordering which express that agents may consider
 mutually exclusive states possible while considering one more likely than
 the other.
 This is the sense in which agents might 
\emph on
prefer
\emph default
 one state over the other.

According to Ditmarsch & Labuschagne, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a psychologically realistic model of an agent capable of interacting intelligent
ly in social situations would be one in which each agent 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 would possess a ToM, comprising, relative to every agent 
\emph on
b
\emph default
, a representation (which may or may not be accurate) of 
\emph on

’s state of mind (accessibility relation, preference relation)

.
 This includes a zero-order theory of mind which does not represent a state
 of mind at all.
 The authors define a doxastic epistemic model, preference relation and
 degrees of belief.
 Their emphasis lies on the different classes of agents which are characterized
 by their preference relation.
 They first refer to a natural class of agents modeled after children with
 autism disorder.
 This class would consist of agents 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
who attributes to every agent 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
a preference relation which is identical to their own.
 The second class is an ideal agent 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
who would attribute a mental state to every agent 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
which is identical to the actual mental state of 
\emph on
b
\emph default
.
 Ditmarsch & Labuschagne refer to this as precisely the situation modeled
 by the possible worlds semantics in epistemic logic.
 Third, a deranged agent 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
simply attributes random or innacurate mental states of others without systemati
c patterns.
 Fourth, there is the limited agent who can correctly attribute some but
 not all mental states to others.
 The limited agent is likely the psychologically most realistic one (possibly
 also for developmental disorders).

While Ditmarsch & Labuschagne takes cognitive insights seriously, there
 are some issues.
 As described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Limitations-to-theconcept"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, research on social cognition might not be as developed as logicians would
 like.
 According to those like Schaafsma et al., it is difficult even for experts
 to navigate what is meant by theory of mind.
 While Ditmarsch & Labuschagne refer to those with autism disorder as having
 a defective theory of mind due to failing a Sally-Anne experiment in a
 seminal paper on autism by Baron-cohen et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "baron autistic have theory of mind"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but 20% of the autistic children in the study in question passed the first-ord
er task while failing a different second-order task.
 Furthermore, some of those with autism disorder can pass theory of mind
 tasks consistently, making some postulate other cognitive impairments as
 explanatory forces for observed behavior 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Frith autism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Passing false-belief tasks might not be necessary nor sufficient for having
 a theory of mind either 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bloom and germany abandon false belief"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The problem of relating limitations of theory of mind to cognitive disorders
 is the contrast to normally developed adults, whose theory of mind is also
 limited, but which such a contrast ignores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not bear on the logical validity of the work of the authors though.
 Logical theories have an important role to play in the study of higher-order
 social reasoning, but in order to make psychologically realistic models,
 it is important that the psychological reality is well understood and this
 is seemingly still under development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example as Verbrugge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 writes, the simulation-theory might describe social cognition better than
 the theory-theory does.
 That is, we might simulate the minds of others rather than reason about
 them, but epistemic logic can still help cognitive science as Ditmarsch
 & Labuschagne writes, since logic can provide 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Pol et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pol ToM DEL"

\end_inset

 have also formalized theory of mind reasoning, specifically through updating
 beliefs about beliefs using dynamic epistemic logic (DEL).
 They found that theory of mind reasoning formalized as such is indeed intractab
le, meaning there is no efficient algorithm capable of solving it.
 The authors also argue that their findings suggest 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that the intractability of theory of mind is not due to the computational
 demands imposed by ‘higher-order reasoning,’ as often assumed in cognitive
 science.
 Instead, our results suggest that intractability of theory of mind may
 be better sought in the computational demands posed by a more general form
 of reasoning about steps of change in time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Such results are important for improving our understanding of what makes
 social reasoning so notoriously difficult as well as for implementing and
 simulating social cognition in artificial agents.
 As the authors mention it would be interesting to see other ways to possibly
 bound the order of reasoning in DEL models, since their logic did not bound
 reasoning but only prove it to intractable.
 Contrary to agents in DEL, human reasoning is bounded by physical constraints
 and not just computational complexity.
 That is, biological organisms are not necessarily capable of solving any
 tractable problem either.
 I now move on to the lack of introspection in relation to limited social
 reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of introspection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some of cognitive limitations comes with appropriate introspection,
 it is likely that limited social cognition is accompanied with a lack of
 introspection.
 While introspection in terms of zero-order reasoning is arguably easier,
 it becomes more complex for higher-order reasoning.
 Take an example from the canteen dilemma, where a player utilizes their
 first-order social reasoning to make an office choice at 8:40 but is otherwise
 sure about going to the canteen at 8:30.
 We might explain the canteen choice at 8:30 by higher order social reasoning,
 because the person might believe that it is right to go the office at 8:40
 but while thinking that the other player wont make that inference.
 A more plausible explanation could be that going to the office at 8:40
 might have required 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-orders of social reasoning, but going to the office at 8:30 required 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-orders, which were cognitively unavailable to the player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there might be a time where a player becomes certain that canteen is
 the right choice due to limited social reasoning and not due to lack of
 faith in the reasoning of others.
 However, this is due to a limitation of the same cognitive processes which
 are required to know that it is limited.
 Imagning oneself performing higher-order reasoning in 'metamode' seems
 to only make it harder.
 The next sections relate to results from the canteen dilemma.
 The accompanying article will contain the primary results and discussion,
 while the following sections will summarize supplementary results, discussions
 as well as considerations and improvements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 The experiment was conducted both on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and at the
 Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
 Results from the canteen dilemma indicate that adults might not just have
 varying cognitive capacities in regards to the orders of social reasoning
 they can apply, but that there might also exist diversity even within those
 applying 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning but not 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

-order reasoning.
 This was indicated by the certainty estimates given by participants regarding
 how certain they were that the other player made the same choice as them.
 The argument for this conclusion is the following.
 Office choices can be interpreted as indicating some higher-order social
 reasoning.
 Those making canteen choices had varying degrees of certainty at different
 times, meaning they choose canteen at different arrival times, with less
 certainty towards later arrival times.
 Since the canteen/office choice was binary, being less certain about canteen
 means more certainty towards office being the right choice.
 So, if office choices indicate social reasoning, then lowering certainty
 about canteen choices does as well.
 But if certainty can be indicative of social reasoning, and certainty can
 be expressed in degrees, it seems possible that social reasoning can be
 exhibited in degrees similar to certainty estimates.
 This would imply in other tests on theory of mind that of those failing
 tasks requiring second-order reasoning, some might be closer to answering
 correctly than others due to a more developed theory of mind, even though
 this detail is ignored in binary results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting result is the participant's lack of introspection into
 the limitations of their higher-order social reasoning.
 The results of the canteen dilemma generally show that players choose the
 office from 8:00 to 8:40, at 8:50 they choose somewhat randomly before
 they opt for the office at 9:00.
 Their certainty estimates indicate social reasoning in the sense that they
 are less certain about going to the canteen at later arrival times.
 But at earlier times, they become certain that the other player has also
 chosen canteen.
 This makes sense if it is exactly the type of social reasoning which is
 limited that is required to realize that the other player might chose different
ly from them.
 Instead of being less certain in such cases, it is plausible that people
 default to zero-order reasoning, assuming that the iterated mutual knowledge
 is simply common knowledge.
 It means that interactions within certain structures like the canteen dilemma
 can not just lead to unsuccesful interaction, it does so without participants
 being able to predict it or understand why it happens.
 We will see evidence for this when we look into free-text answers given
 by certain participants, which I will go through below as well as some
 supplementary results not included in the article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supplementary results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first supplementary result is shown in Figure 3 below.
 It is motivated by the question whether participants always made the same
 choice for each arrival time or whether they changed their decisions throughout
 the game.
 The blue bars show the percentage of players who chose canteen at time
 
\emph on

\emph default
and then then chose office when they got time 
\emph on

 again.
 The orange bar shows the converse for choosing office and later changing
 to canteen.

The confidence intervals show that participants did not frequently get the
 same arrival times multiple times, which results in wide confidence intervals.
 The plot generally shows that those choosing canteen at earlier arrival
 times did not change their decision later, while the few that chose office
 were more inclined to change to canteen.
 There is one interesting point at 8:50 however.
 The plot shows that those arriving at 8:50 were more susceptible to change
 from canteen to office than the other way around.
 This indicates that there is a type of learning happening at 8:50 but not
 at 8:40.
 The apparent lack of learning of higher-order social reasoning in games
 is also shown in Verbrugge & Mol

Strategy categorization

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in both the AMT and DTU trials were asked the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What strategy did you use while playing this game?".
 While these answers are harder to quantify than other answers, they provide
 insight into the reasoning and thoughts of the participants.
 This is helpful both because even if behavior in the canteen dilemma is
 correctly explained by a specific type of higher-order social reasoning,
 it only provides evidence of implicit reasoning.
 Participants may make decisions because of social reasoning which they
 are not themselves explicitly aware of.
 Explicit strategy answers provide insight into this aspect.
 These answers were quantified by devising a set of categories for various
 types of answers.
 The table below includes both the AMT and the two DTU experiments.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the dominating categories was (3) which included answers which simply
 state that their strategy was based on the time they arrived, without much
 clarification.
 Many of these answers had the form of going to the canteen early and office
 later, see for example the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How close to the 9:00 cutoff I arrived at work determined where I would
 go
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This answer is consistent with most if not all strategies, but the most
 plausible interpreation is that it refers to going to the canteen with
 certainty until some time before 9:00, where they either became less certain
 or started to make office choices.
 Other answers also allows for better interpretation of behavior in terms
 of higher-order social reasoning.
 See for example the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried to think of the other guy arriving 10 minutes later than I did and
 choose accordingly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This plausibly implies going to the office at 8:50 and canteen at 8:40.
 But does it involve infer representational mental states about the other?
 Possibly not, because the other person's arrival time is a fact about the
 world which they can infer based on their own arrival time.
 That is, when arriving at 8:50, the other person might have arrived at
 9:00 and this can be deduced regardless of the other persons mental state.
 See also the AMT answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The farther from 9 the more certain I was of canteen.
 If it was 9 or later I was more certain of office
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Being less than maximally certain about going to the canteen at 8:40 and
 earlier requires higher-order social reasoning, but the answer in question
 does not refer to this reasoning at all.
 Of course they might just not mention it, but it is also possible that
 there is an implicit or automatic reasoning process which intuitively informs
 the participant's choices.
 The reliance of intuition and common sense is also indicated by some answers,
 for example in the AMT answer, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Common sense, at least I thought :(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 indicating both that they relied on common sense while also acknowledging
 that something seemed to go wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Supplementary free text questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in the DTU trials were asked a few supplementary questions
 besides those in the AMT trial.
 Participants in the DTU trial were asked the same question as in the AMT
 trial: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imagine you could have agreed beforehand with your colleague about a point
 in time where it is safe to go to the canteen.
 What time would that be?".
 The most popular answer was 8:40, while around 73% answered either 8:30,
 8:40 or 8:50.
 See Appendix A for a barchart for these results.
 After answering this question, DTU participants were asked the question
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you ever go to the canteen at an arrival time later than what was safe
 according to your previous answer? Why or why not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The results were categorized in positive, negative and miscellaneous answers,
 which can be seen in the following barchart.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These answers generally indicate that participants in both DTU trials answered
 positively (63% and 64%) that they did go to the canteen at times later
 than when would have been if they could have made an agreement with their
 colleague.
 Some of these answers are qualfied with reference to lower certainty, see
 this answer from the first DTU trial: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 Yes I did, but then I could not be very certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
 Other answers are similar, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, at 8:40.
 Because it seemed almost safe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
 Other answers refer to intuition as well: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 Yes, because it was possible, to go there safely and intuitively made sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The last answer was given by a participant answering answering that their
 cutoff for safely going to the canteen would be 8:20.
 This means going to the office at 8:30 (and later) which is indicative
 of second-order reasoning.
 When choosing the canteen at later times anyway, it is possibly because
 this reflective reasoning does not seem as important in practical cases.
 The reference to intuition possibly means that even when their higher-order
 social reasoning entails that going to the canteen is not safe at later
 times, their intuition overrides this and they rely on some other default
 reasoning.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changing strategy during the game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in the DTU trials were also asked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you ever choose differently after seeing the same arrival time again
 at a later point in the game? Why or why not?

 These answers were also put into three categorizes, positive, negative
 and miscellaneous.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answers are grouped around positive affirmation again (51% and 57%) rather
 than negative (35% and 36%).
 The positive answers refer to either adjusting their strategy based on
 their partners earlier choices or from learning more about the game.
 One person explicitly states: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes because after a few rounds I realized it is never safe to go canteen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The positive answers from the first DTU trial indicated a focus on learning
 about the structure of the game and the impossibility of safely establishing
 canteen coordination compared to the second DTU trial which relied more
 on reacting to their partner.
 The general dominance of positive answers indicate that participants do
 not rely on backwards induction alone, viewing each round as a one-shot
 game.
 Rather, many took earlier behavior into account, besides also reasoning
 more about the structure of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supplementary discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An essential part of experiments which elicit beliefs from participants
 depend on other implicit assumptions about their beliefs.
 Inferring and understanding why participants might have behaved like the
 did in the canteen dilemma therefore depends on implicit assumptions about
 their understanding of the structure of the game.
 There is as such a few aspects of the results which warrants methodological
 discussion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Participants in both AMT and two DTU trials chose canteen at 8:50, 47%,
 43% and 64% of the time, respectively.
 The rules of the game is intended to entail the three following propositions:
 (a) you are given an arrival time each round and know the other player
 arrives 10 minutes before or after yourself, (b) you have to chose between
 canteen and office in every round, (c) if you arrive at 9:00 or 9:10 you
 have to go to the office and (d) you have to do the same as the other player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does a significant amount of participants chose canteen at 8:50 then?
 It is possible that they understood (a) to (d) above and simply took a
 chance, knowing the other might arrive at 9:00 and knowing that that the
 other would choose the office.
 This explains why it is centered around 50%, as it is interpreted to be
 50/50 what the other player does.
 This is also shown in some strategy answers, see for example the following:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried to play it safe.
 It's obvious to go the canteen anytime before 8:40, but when 8:50 comes
 up it's a gamble.
 I messed up by assuming my partner would agree once, but after that I played
 it safe so I would lose less.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (AMT strategy answer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If i arrived at 0900, go to office.
 At 0850, assume other person went to office and go to office.
 At 0840 assume other person assumed I went to office and go to office At
 0830 50/50 bet At 0800 to 0820 assume other is also betting on canteen.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 (First DTU trial)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last strategy answer refers to going to the office at 8:50 and 8:40
 as well.
 Notice that at 8:30, they apply second-order reasoning, as they imagine
 the other arriving at 8:40 and attributes first-order reasoning to them.
 This means that the random choice at 8:50 is moved to 8:30 for this participant
, while higher-order reasoning is ignored for earlier arrival times.
 The first answer written above even states that it's obvious to go to the
 canteen at earlier times, likely due to lack of higher-order social reasoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that participants chose canteen at 8:50 due to different
 reasons too however.
 They might have interpreted the rules such that they did not infer the
 propositions above.
 They might not have inferred (c) and thought they could go to the canteen
 at 9:00, meaning it would be okay to go to the canteen at 8:50 if the other
 did the same at 9:00.
 They might have also have ignored (d) and thought that they could go to
 the canteen as long as 
\emph on
they 
\emph default
arrived before 9:00.
 The rules in the AMT and first DTU trial stated 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you arrive before 9:00 am, you have time to go to the canteen, but you
 should only go if your colleague goes to the canteen as well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which can be reasonably interpreted as 8:50 being an acceptable time to
 go to the canteen.
 While a reasonable interpretation, the rules continue stating: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you or your colleague arrive at 9:00 am or after, you should go straight
 to your offices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This arguably overrides the previous statement, but since the other statement
 comes first, it is possible it has been prioritized.
 This was tested however in the second DTU trial, where the sentence was
 changed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 arrive before 9:00 am ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where 62% of participants choose canteen at 8:50 (see Appendix B for plot
 of their choices).
 While different populations, it provides some evidence that the formulation
 of the rules did not lead to canteen choices at 8:50.
 Canteen choices at 8:50 might therefore be understood as gambles, which
 were somewhat calculated as we also see the lowest certainty estimates
 at this arrival time.
 If this behavior is assumed to be common, it poses a problem since makes
 canteen choices favorable at 8:40 regardless of one's reasoning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also the question why some (circa 10% in the AMT trial) have chosen
 canteen at 9:00 and 9:10 which are zero-order reasoning failures.
 Part of the explanation is random answers, since we would expect some participa
nts to either choose randomly or intentionally choose opposite their preferences
 (trolling).
 This accounts for some of the answers which also explains some of the around
 7-10% of participants choosing office from 8:00 to 8:30.
 In other words, this might be the level of background noise in the data,
 such that these office choices are not necessarily indicative of reasoning
 either.
 This seems to be supported by the first DTU trial.
 The first DTU trial included students enrolled in a course focused on logical
 models of artificial agents.
 The demographic was therefore both primed in terms of theory of mind and
 in a setting where they are used to be tested on their interpretation of
 logical of statements.
 The first DTU trial had 4% and 0% choosing canteen at 9:00 and 9:10 respectivel
y, and 0 percent choosing office at 8:00 and 8:10.
 It indicates that these DTU students generally had a good a zero-order
 understanding of the structure of the game, which means that it was at
 least possible to make such an interpretation of the rules.
 
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

Another possibility as to why the amount of canteen choices seem high is
 the effect of the framing narrative.
 Participants might rely on their own preferences over those stated in the
 game, implying that they do not really believe that there is any benefit
 of going to the office together before you absolutely have to.
 While they might intuitively understand the preference of going to the
 canteen with their colleague, it might be less intuitive to understand
 why going to the office is only preferable if the other does so as well.
 This explanation assumes participants to have understood the rules well,
 but without being sufficiently aware of the payoff structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing from the discussion above, there are a few ways the canteen dilemma
 experiment could have been methodologically improved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, pilot-testing is always important in such experiments and the pilot-testi
ng of the canteen dilemma could possibly have been improved by meta-questions.
 These could be general questions about the game, such as whether they were
 able to understand and recall the rules, if they had had enough time in
 the experiment or similar questions which would make it easier to optimize
 the description of the game.
 This could also involve participants playing a set of practice rounds before
 entering the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the behavior of participants could have been interpreted more robustly
 by including linguistic controls.
 A linguistic control question would be question that could be answered
 correctly if and only if a person has made a specific interpretation of
 the rules.
 Such a question could ask participants what they should do in various crucial
 scenarios in the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, the general interpretation of the rules could also have been aided
 by re-stating them in a more intuitive story.
 The implicit possibility of going to the office at any time could also
 have been emphasized, or tested for in a linguistic control.
 The rules could for example emphasize a story where two colleagues generally
 want to work on an important project together, which requires both of them
 to work on and which they have to work on from 9:00 at the latest, but
 also possibly earlier.
 This could mean pumping the intuition of always being allowed to work on
 a project together, while not always being allowed to go the canteen due
 to an important deadline.
 Even though the payoff structure implicitly emphasized the importance of
 avoiding discoordination (more than half of the participants in the AMT
 trial lost their entire bonus due to discoordination), the facilitating
 narrative could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of avoiding
 discoordination.
 Earlier arrival times could also have been left out, putting an emphasis
 on for example third-order social reasoning.
 The participants could also have been given the same arrival times in a
 fixed order with this being common knowledge.
 The game could also be structured differently such that participants were
 automatically assigned to the office at 9:00 and 9:10.
 A more drastic change would be that payoff for choosing office was independent
 on the other player while payoff for choosing canteen was not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth, the structure of the game and its questions could be tailored towards
 more narrowly defined hypotheses, as well as having a more narrow focus
 within social cognition.
 Some existing questions could simply be altered, for example the question
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Imagine you arrive at 8:00 am.
 Is it common knowledge between you and your colleague that it is safe to
 go to the canteen, that is, you both arrived before 9:00 am?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could be changed such that the arrival time in question was randomly generated.
 Delimiting terminology and focus within social cognition is of course difficult
 due to the diffuse taxonomy of the field.
 The focus of the canteen dilemma could have been delimited by focusing
 either on explicit/reflective social cognition or implicit/spontaneous
 social cognition.
 This could also be testing the degree to which such reasoning could be
 replicated by other cognitive processes which does not involve representation
 of mental states, like 'submentalizing' described by Heyes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes submentalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which she argues could be both a substrate and subsitute for thinking
 about the minds of others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Future research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cognitive capacity of attributing mental states to others have been
 the focus of numerous studies but still remains surprisingly enigmatic.
 It has often been described as 'theory of mind' but this term has been
 criticized by researchers like Schaafsma et al, who argue that its meaning
 is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vague and inconsistent, its biological bases are a subject of debate, and
 the methods used to study it are highly heterogeneous 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 65"
key "Schaafsma deconstructing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The cognitive capacity in question is undeniably central to our social
 life however and it is therefore important to understand its complexity.
 Appreciating that others have minds of their own could consist of a conglomerat
e of implicit and explicit cognitive processes, some which might relate
 more to behavior than mental states.
 This calls for research of the possibly unexplored diversity of processes
 and aspects of social cognition, including subsequently improved terminology,
 which would aid numerous research fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cognitive science and psychology could benefit in terms of improving our
 understanding of both cognitive development in children as well as the
 fully fledged capacities and limitations of adults.
 By getting a more accurate description of how adults infer representational
 mental states of others, logic and computer science could make more realistic
 computational models of human reasoning.
 If artificially intelligent agents are to understand and predict human
 reasoning, including prediction of how their own action might be perceived
 by humans, it is important that they have an idea of how humans might reason
 and not just how they might ought to reason.
 As Heyes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heyes submentalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, some cases where mentalizing is inferred might better be understood
 as sub-mentalizing, that is, domain-general cognitive mechanisms which
 simulate mentalizing in social contexts.
 As has been mentioned previously, this supports the argument from Erb 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Erb - AI and ToM"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, that humans might very well start assigning intentions, beliefs and motives
 to non-human counterparts.
 As development continues on ambient technology such as self-driving cars,
 voice assistants or other technology involving human-computer interaction,
 it comes increasingly important for computational agents to be able to
 both make human-like inferences such that humans can understand and predict
 their behavior, and make inferences about human inferences in order to
 predict their behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the central role which intentions, beliefs and mental states have
 in philosophy, developing a nuanced understanding of social cognition is
 relevant for philosophy as well, from epistemology, philosophy of mind,
 ethics and logic.
 While social cognition by nature ignores some philosophical problems like
 solipsism, it can have immense importance in relation to modern problems.
 Agent-centered deontological moral theory states for example that actions
 are permissible depending on the intentions of the agent, but this means
 that any moral evaluation of the actions of others depends the capacity
 to understand the intentions of others.
 That is to say that insights from social cognition can put moral problems
 in an epistemological light.
 Problems in social epistemology like pluralistic ignorance are also highly
 related to such research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The canteen dilemma added to the possible diversity of this cognitive capacity,
 as it indicates that there might be variation even among just 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning.
 A possible avenue for future research would be to map some of these details,
 for example testing if and under what circumstance some first-order reasoners
 might be closer to second-order reasoning than others.
 Empirical nuance also makes it easier to establish a scientifically tractable
 terminology for accurately describing this interesting cognitive phenomena.
 While the term 'theory of mind' is sometimes used vaguely, it is understandingl
y difficult for researchers to use better terms for a concept if its complexity

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis presented and introduced a large and still developing research
 field on higher-order social cognition.
 This is the study of the cognitive capacity to mentally represent possible
 mental states of others, such as beliefs, desires or intentions.
 The thesis included a critical discussion of the heterogeneity of terms
 and methods used to study this capacity.
 I also discussed the importance of researching actual cognitive capacities
 in relation to logic and computational models for reasoning in computer
 science, often thought to be normative in nature and independent of how
 humans actually reason.
 This works as an introduction to the accompanying article on the canteen
 dilemma experiment conducted at the Center for Information and Bubble Studies
 (CIBS).
 Various results are discussed, such as limited higher-order social cognition
 as well as a lack of introspection.
 Results indicated that even within those who only have the capacity for
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-order social reasoning, some might be closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 than others.
 This implies some type of continuity of the various degrees of higher order
 social reasoning which are ignored by typical descriptions of higher-order
 reasoning in integers.
 If this result can be corroborated, it can improve both (i) our understanding
 of the developmental aspect of social cognition, since it does not posit
 some jump between orders of reasoning and (i) psychologically realistic
 models of human reasoning in logic and economy, since it shows evidence
 of types of agents otherwise ignored.
