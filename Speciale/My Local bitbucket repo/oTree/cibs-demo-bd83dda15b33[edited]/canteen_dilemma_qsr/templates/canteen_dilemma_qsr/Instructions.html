    </p>
    <p>
        This game is about trying to do the same as your colleague. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Every morning you arrive at work between 8:00am and 9:10am.
        You and your colleague will arrive by bus 10 minutes apart.
        <i>
          Example: You arrive at <strong>8:40am</strong>.
          Your colleague can arrive at <strong>8:30am</strong>, or <strong>8:50am</strong>.
        </i>
    </p>
    <p> Both of you like to meet in the canteen for a coffee. If you arrive before 9:00am,
     you have time to go to the canteen, but you should only go if your colleague goes to
      the canteen as well. If you or your colleague arrive at 9:00am or after, you should go straight to your offices.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the beginning of each round you will know only your own arrival time
        and you will have to decide whether to go to the canteen or
        to your office. After each round you will be asked to estimate how certain 
        you are that you made the same choice as your colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Payoff and penalties:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You start the game with {{ Constants.endowment }} and will have to pay
        various amounts of penalties in each round, depending on how well
        you both do. Your challenge is to have as much money left as possible when the game ends, after
        which the remaining amount is paid out to you as a bonus. The game
        ends after {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds or when you or your
        colleague has no more money left.
    </p>
  
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Both go to canteen</strong>
            <p>
            If you guess correctly that both of you went to the
            canteen before 9:00am, you pay a <strong>small</strong> penalty
            proportional to how <strong>uncertain</strong> you were, e.g.:
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -0.69|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very uncertain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -0.29|c }}</strong>
                    if you were somewhat certain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -0.01|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very certain.
            </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Both go to office</strong>
            <p>
            If you guessed correctly that both of you went to your
            offices, no matter what time, your penalty is
            <strong> doubled </strong> and proportional to how <strong>uncertain</strong> you were, e.g.:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -1.39|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very uncertain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -0.58|c }}</strong>
                    if you were somewhat certain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -0.02|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very certain.
            </p> 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>One go to canteen, one go to office</strong>
            <p>
            If you miss each other, and one of you goes to the canteen while the
            other goes to the office - or if any of you goes to the canteen at
            9:00am or after, your penalty is <strong>doubled</strong>
            and proportional to how <strong>certain</strong> you were, e.g.:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -1.39|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very uncertain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -2.77|c }}</strong>
                    if you were somewhat certain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ -9.21|c }}</strong>
                    if you were very certain.
            </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
