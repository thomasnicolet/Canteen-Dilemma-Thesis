This experiment investigates the classical Beauty Contest with alternative
payoff structures. In the classical Keynes Beauty Contest everybody picks
a number from 0 to 100. The average of all picks is computed, and whoever's
number is closest to two-thirds of that average wins a fixed amount of dollars,
say $50.

This Game of Regret is a bit different. First of all: it is iterated over
several rounds with the same group of participants, making it possible to
signal intentions of cooperation. Second, the winner(s) will not receive a
fixed amout but either the equivalent of their guess in dollars (treatment
"no split"), or the equivalent of their guess divided by the number of
winners (treatment "split").

            If this subsession is repeated (i.e. has multiple rounds), this
            field stores the position (index) of this subsession, among subsessions
            in the same app.
            For example, if a session consists of the subsessions:
            [app1, app2, app1, app1, app3]
            Then the round numbers of these subsessions would be:
            [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
