Subsession
    round_number
        type

        doc
            If this subsession is repeated (i.e. has multiple rounds), this
            field stores the position (index) of this subsession, among subsessions
            in the same app.
            For example, if a session consists of the subsessions:
            [app1, app2, app1, app1, app3]
            Then the round numbers of these subsessions would be:
            [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
