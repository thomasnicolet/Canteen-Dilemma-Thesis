Cascade Market: Documentation
*****************************

Accessed: 2017-10-13


In this experiment a firm is represented with a bag, containing a
variable number of 'good' and 'bad' items. Players have to pull
out one item and guess the overall state of the firm, e.g. whether it is
in a mainly 'good' or 'bad' condition. Informational cascades will
form, but since the urn changes its state with a fixed probability,
a mix of strategies need to be employed. Players can choose how many previous
public guesses they want to see (counted backwards) before making a guess.

            If this subsession is repeated (i.e. has multiple rounds), this
            field stores the position (index) of this subsession, among subsessions
            in the same app.
            For example, if a session consists of the subsessions:
            [app1, app2, app1, app1, app3]
            Then the round numbers of these subsessions would be:
            [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
