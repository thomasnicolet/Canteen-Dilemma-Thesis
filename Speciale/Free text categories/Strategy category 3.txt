 Strategy answer:  I tried to pay close attention to the arrival timing of the other participant.  The closer it was to 8AM, the more certain I was that they would go to the canteen.  I was frustrated when they went to the office as I'm not sure the other player had a solid game plan and could not communicate with them.
