\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 55e4n5z6 Strategy answer: I tried to do my best to
 understand what the other participant was going to do.
 It appeared that we somehow understood each other and always chose the
 canteen (after the first misstep).
 Therefore, since we were on the same page every trial, I kept selecting
 canteen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[### important ###]Code for particpant: 8s4vhpit Strategy answer: If it
 was close to 9:00AM, within 20 minutes or so, I would go to the office.
 Otherwise I would just chose to go to the canteen.
 Unfortunately it almost worked out for everyone except one, and I have
 no idea why they would have chosen to go to the office on said round because
 it was really early and we would have had plenty of time to go to the canteen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[#Notice that at 8:40, there is 'time to go to the canteen'#]Code for particpant
: u0i326sb Strategy answer: I thought that if I arrived at 9:10 or later
 I'd simply go to the office, since my partner would at the earliest have
 to head to the office as well.
 If I arrived 9:00 I'd go to the office and hope that odds favored my partner
 and their time also indicated the same (taking a chance).
 If I arrived at 8:50, I'd go to the canteen and hope their time indicated
 that as well.
 And any times prior to 8:50 I'd simply go to the canteen since there would
 be time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[#Notice theory of mind implies that answers arent obvious but the limit
 of the very same capacity makes earlier times seem obvious]Code for particpant:
 4gg7gacn Strategy answer: Most of the time it was obvious which option
 to choose.
 If it wasn't, I just went with my gut.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[#Notice how ToM implies uncertainty at some arrival times but lack of ToM
 implies safety at others]Code for particpant: kg3r6f8z Strategy answer:
 most the choices required no thought and were a sure choice.
 on the uncertain ones i guess and tried to play off them 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: so1zjmfk Strategy answer: It was easy to figure out
 until I got the 8:50 time.
 I chose to go to the canteen knowing that it was 50/50 whether they would
 have gotten there in time to go to the canteen or net.
 Because of that I said I was uncertain for that round trying to mitigate
 the loss if we did not choose the same action.
 [Game is easy until crucial time occurs]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 41zq2w8e Strategy answer: I tried to play it safe.
 It's obvious to go the canteen anytime before 8:40, but when 8:50 comes
 up it's a gamble.
 I messed up by assuming my partner would agree once, but after that I played
 it safe so I would lose less.
 [Again, it's easy before 8:40, but at 8:40 or later, our theory of mind
 is strong enough to kick in]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: ikw8x1y0 Strategy answer: I tried to make my judgement
 based off my arrival time and whether or not my colleague would have enough
 time as well.
 [Evidence that 8:50-office is due to considering whether both players have
 time to go the canteen, not what the other player thinks]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 9372t862 Strategy answer: I chose to go with the canteen
 unless my time was around 8:50 AM or 9:00 AM because my partner would be
 uncertain if I would arrive 10 minutes before or after them.
 We were lucky enough to be thinking on the same page every time.
 [Assumption that because both stuck to office at 8:50 and later, they could
 coordinate]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: cwjc9wrz Strategy answer: I just went with my gut.
 I chose answers based on what I would really do.
 [Some participants simply make choices depending on what they themselves
 would do]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: slphrqhm Strategy answer: I trusted my partner and
 only went to the canteen when it was 100% safe for both of us [This likely
 implies going to the canteen at 8:40, since the participant knows that
 (late) is false.
 But this belief is due to 0-order reasoning which does not take into account
 the other players knowledge.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: hky1rqw0 Strategy answer: I based my decision on what
 time my partner had and how likely it was that their time was guaranteed
 to arrive to work before 9:00am [Another case of considering the arrival
 time of the other player, but only in terms of (late) being true or not]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 7nnamfnb Strategy answer: if the variabilty of my partner
 overlapped with the 9 am or not.
 [Again, go to canteen if you know late is false, and you know (late) is
 false if your arrival time is not 8:50, 9:00 or 9:10]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: zittq6wn Strategy answer: I followed the rules, that
 before 9.00am we'd have time for coffe.
 I arrived at 8.40, so the latest the other person could arrive was 8.50.
 Time for coffee and I was certain of this.
 When the opposite cenario happened, I followed what they did last time,
 and they this time went to the canteen.
 Inconsistent! [A case of 0-order reasoning, reasoning about whether (late)
 is false.
 (late) is false whenever noone arrives at 9:00.
 If one player arrives at 8:50, (late) might be true.
 So if canteen choices can only be made if and only if (late) is false,
 the then 8:50 is not a certain canteen choice even in regard to 0-order
 reasoning.
 But 8:40 is, because the player knows that (late) is false, which is knowledge
 about states of affairs, which is 0-order social knowledge]
\end_layout

DTU1 Strategy answers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: nqj339em Strategy answer: Found the limit for there
 the co worker would go to the office and then based my choices on that.
 Basically at 8.30 you don't know if the co worker will arrive at 8.20 and
 go the the canteen or 8.40 and thus go to the office.
 The same goes for arriving at 8.40.
 The rest of the answers were trivial after discovering this.
 [At 8:30, you consider that the other player arrived at 8:40, and went
 to the office because he considered you arriving at 8:50, entailing office,
 that is 2-order reasoning.
 But the rest of the answers (e.g.
 8:20 are deemed trivial, since 3-order reasoning is not considered)]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: luykbvrv Strategy answer: At first it was very certain
 that I went to the canteen if I arrived 8.40 or earlier.
 But this was expensive if my buddy went to the office at 8.50.
 So I tried to be more conservative when arriving 8.40 or later.
 The best strategy would be for both to go to the office everytime.
 [Figuring out office only strat!]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: fkb63rpz Strategy answer: It was easy for 8:00, 8:10
 and 8:20.
 There I would go to the canteen based on the fact, that my friend would
 arrive at latest at 8:30, and then they would in worst case scenario think
 that I arrived at 8:40.
 Thus we would both go for coffee.
 In the case of 8:30, I would also go to the canteen, but I would not be
 very certain cause my friend might be there at 8:40 and think that I would
 be there at 8:50.
 They might think that IF I am there at 8:50, I would think that my friend
 is there at 9:00, and thus I might go to the office.
 Thus for 8:30 and above it is not certain.
 It would depend on the history of our decisions...
 [This is 2nd or 3rd order reasoning.
 Notice that it also includes some forward inductive reasoning (earlier
 choices being important) and that 8:20 and earlier are simply deemed easy]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: bvrck71g Strategy answer: Tried to figure out what
 choices would be made around the 8.50 mark.
 Because the other person could have arrived around the 8.40 or 9.00 mark.
 If we both figured out to go to the office at 8.40+ times, we could even
 out our answers.
 But we never found a flow.
 [Exhibits the belief that if only they had used the appropriate strategy,
 they could have gone to the canteen safely]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: tgsev17z Strategy answer: From 8:00 to 8:20 I went
 to the canteen and expected my teammate to do the same with high confidence.
 From 8:30 to 8:40 I went to the canteen but with less certainty.
 From 8:50 to 9:00 I went to the office with average certainty, and at 9:10
 I went to the office with high confidence.
 [Good introspection, in the sense that many players did this.
 Uncertainty at 8:30 and 8:40 indicates 1-2 orders of ToM]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Important DTU2 Strategy answers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: d80v1d76 Strategy answer: Go to canteen if it's before
 8:50 AM If 8:50 AM one should consider the posibility that the colleague
 is arriving 10 minutes after and therefore can't make it to the canteen.
 [Indicates office choice at 8:50, but due to reasoning about the world,
 i.e.
 the person considers it possible that the other player arrived at 9:00,
 i.e.
 meaning canteen would be the wrong choice]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: m34i6dkf Strategy answer: If math checks out both of
 us goes to canteen.
 If i know that one of us may not get there in time, i do office with low
 certainty [Same reasoning as 'd80v1d76' above.
 If the player knows that it might not be possible for both to go to the
 canteen (which the player knows solely based on his own arrival time),
 he might choose office at 8:50]
