10. Learning: changing strategy through game

 Strategy answer:  I thought if the time was 8:50 or earlier then I would have time to go to the canteen. I thought my partner would think that as well. Later in the game I realized that maybe 8:50 was cutting it too close and that I should go to the office instead. It seemed that strategy played out the best.
