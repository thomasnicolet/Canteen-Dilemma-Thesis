Canteen till 8:40, office at 9:00, intuition/flip coin at 8:50
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 3bzgh6vt Strategy answer: I tried to determine if we
 would have time to go to the canteen.
 If not, we would go to the office.
 [At 8:50 you might or might not have time to go to the canteen]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: j7iqae18 Strategy answer: Check the possible range.
 If there was no chance of 9am then 100% certain.
 [If 9:00 is not possible, i.e.
 8:40, then 100% certain at canteen, implying you'd be less certain at 8:50]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: g50ezvlw Strategy answer: I tried to go to the canteen
 when I was sure we both had enough time before 9:00AM and to the office
 when it was too close to 9 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 3p7y30a1 Strategy answer: If it was close to 9:00,
 I went to the office and assumed my partner would do the same since that
 would make sense.
 I don't really think my partner behaved logically.
 [Loosely time based strategy, close to 9:00 likely means 8:50]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 51s7w8wy Strategy answer: If I knew that my colleague
 was going to get to the office before 9 am I chose canteen and then very
 certain.
 I chose this because there was no reason for them to go straight to the
 office.
 I guessed what they would do when there was a chance they wouldn't have
 time to go to the canteen.
 [If the person knows both arrive before 9, i.e.
 if person arrives at 8:40 or earlier, very certain at canteen.
 Implying that if it is not the case, he wont be certain at the canteen]

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 0iusd3w7 Strategy answer: Always very certain of office
 unless arrive 9.00 or later.
 8.50 was a gamble 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: uwksz3ti Strategy answer: I decided to go to the office
 if I came at 8.50 or later, otherwise to the canteen.
 I chose to (somewhat) uncertain when I arrived at either 8.40 or 8.50, otherwise
 I was very certain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: getiy58s Strategy answer: For everthing except 8.40
 and 8.50 I played very certain.
 For 8.40 I chose canteen but with slight uncertainty.
 8.50 was office with very uncertain 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: f308g8k0 Strategy answer: Always go the canteen unless
 itâ€™s 8:50 or later.
 If I arrive at 8:50 then I chose canteen or office randomly because the
 other person could have arrived at 9:00 or 8:40.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: wzhpir90 Strategy answer: I said very uncertain at
 8.50 and 9.00, and picked the corresponding "right" choice for me.
 I didn't start out doing this, I started by picking random at 8.50 and 9.00,
 but change it a few rounds in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 1rwicug6 Strategy answer: go to the canteen whenever
 there is a chance.
 If not sure, reduce uncertainty [Indicative of going to canteen at all
 times before 9:00, and with lower certainty at 8:50]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Code for particpant: 62drd1wd Strategy answer: For 8:50 an bellow I always
 choose to go to the canteen, for 9:00 and above I choose to go to the office.
 It seem like the other player did that to.
 If I got 8:40 and below I would be very certain that the other player goes
 to the canteen likewise if I arrived at 9:10 or above we would booth go
 to the office.
 If I got 8:50 I would choose to go to the canteen, but there would be a
 50% chance that the other player did that to, so I the best payoff would
 come from being very uncertain likewise for 9:00
