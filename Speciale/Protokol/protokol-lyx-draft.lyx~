\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Canteen Dilemma experiment is meant to investigate what happens when
 people have to coordinate their actions without common knowledge.
 In the research literature, group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
have 
\emph on
common knowledge 
\emph default
that 
\emph on
A
\emph default
 when everyone in group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
knows 
\emph on
A
\emph default
, and everyone in group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
knows that everyone in group 
\emph on
G
\emph default
 knows A, and everyone in group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
knows that everyone in group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
knows that everyone in group 
\emph on
G 
\emph default
knows 
\emph on
A
\emph default
 etc.
 etc.
 Common knowledge is an essential aspect of social cognition, i.e.
 reasoning about the reasoning of others.
 In everyday use of the concept, common knowledge often refers to either
 something that everyone knows (called 
\emph on
mutual knowledge
\emph default
 in the research literature) or even just something that most people believe.
 The importance of common knowledge is not always intuitive.
 The Canteen Dilemma is intended to investigate the extend to which people
 recursively model the mental states of others and how important they think
 this is in coordination games.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Canteen Dilemma is structurally similar to the Consecutive Numbers example
 in (Ditmarsch et al., 2008).
 In this example, two agents, 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
(Anne) and 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 (Bill), face each other and can each see a number on the other's head.
 The numbers are consecutive numbers 
\emph on
n 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
n+1 
\emph default
for a certain 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 For our example, assume the possible numbers are 0 to 10.
 These facts are common knowledge for Anne and Bill.
 As an example, assume that Anne has the number 3 and Bill has 2.
 Now imagine that we ask them if it is common knowledge that they both have
 numbers higher than 0.
 If one of them had a 0, the other would see this and conclude that their
 own number must be a 1.
 So our question is equivalent to asking if it's common knowledge that none
 of them know their number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us check.
 Anne and Bill both know their numbers must be higher than 0, Since Anne
 sees a 2 and Bill sees a 3, so 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg a_{0}\wedge\neg b_{0})$
\end_inset

, where 
\emph on
E 
\emph default
denotes some proposition is mutual knowledge for some agents.
 Now notice that since Anne can see a 2, she thinks it's possible she has
 1 and Bill has 2: 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}(a_{1}\wedge b_{2})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}A$
\end_inset

 means that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
considers 
\emph on
A
\emph default
 possible, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}\varphi:=\neg K_{a}\neg\varphi$
\end_inset

 ).
 In that situation, Bill might not know his own number, since he sees a
 1, but since he might have a 0 in that situation, he considers it possible
 that Anne might know her number.
 So we have: 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg a_{0}\wedge\neg b_{0})\land\neg E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg a_{0}\wedge\neg b_{0})$
\end_inset

 .
 So while both Anne and Bill know that their numbers are higher than 0,
 not everyone knows this epistemic fact, so it is not common knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

This is important in some cases, for example if we told Anne and Bill that
 they have to cooperate their actions in the following way.
 Assume that they get a large reward if both choose B while none of them
 have a 0, a smaller reward for both choosing A regardless of their number,
 and a large penalty for either making different choices or one choosing
 B when one of them has a 0.
 In our case 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{3}\wedge b_{2}),$
\end_inset

 both know they would get the largest reward if they both chose B.
 But since Anne sees a 2 on Bill, she thinks she might have a 1.
 If she has a 1, Bill would think he might have a 0, and he knows that Anne
 has to choose A if he has a 0, making him choose A as well.
 So since they don't have common knowledge about their numbers, the only
 safe strategy is choosing A.
 This holds no matter what number they have.
 This is highly unintuitive and it is this aspect of theoretical social
 cognition that the Canteen Dilemma is meant to capture.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Respondents in the Canteen Dilemma are similar story to the Consecutive
 Numbers game.
 Players are told that they and their colleague arrive at work every morning
 between 8:00 am and 9:10 am and that they always arrive 10 minutes apart.
 If they both arrive before 9:00 am, they have time to go to the canteen
 for a coffee.
 If either arrive at 9:00 am or after, they have to go to their offices.
 Players are rewarded if they both go to the canteen before 9:00 am and
 get a smaller reward if they both go to their offices at any time.
 They get penalized if they either go to different places or if one goes
 to the canteen at 9:00 am or later.
 Much like the consecutive numbers game, players only have common knowledge
 that they arrive 10 minutes apart, but no common knowledge about their
 arrival time.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structure of the Canteen Dilemma can be found in coordination problems
 in everyday life when people communicate through text.
 In such cases, people might have mutual knowledge but no proper common
 knowledge.
 This experiment is intended to investigate the way people act and reason
 in such cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Research Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Common knowledge is an important theoretical concept in epistemic logic.
 It can be difficult for people to imagine cases where the difference between
 mutual knowledge and common knowledge has practical significance however.
 Our experiment exhibits a structure where the lack of common knowledge
 makes a tangible difference.
 Our research questions and hypotheses relies on this fact and can be expressed
 like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The theoretical concept of common knowledge does not match our everyday
 notions of common knowledge.
 The infinite recursive modeling of other's beliefs does not occur in everyday
 situations and at most 2-3 iterations happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most respondent will reason to approximately the same depth, which is 2-3
 iterations of social reasoning.
 In other words, players will at most reason about others, reasoning about
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Respondents will intentionally limit their reasoning depth because they
 find this depth sufficient for the task at hand.
 In other words, a limited reasoning depth is not necessarily due to lack
 of capacity in respondents but also due to the belief that a more iterations
 are not necessary to succeed in the game.
 I.e.
 respondents have the false belief that arriving early enough warrants that
 it is safe to go the canteen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our general research questions are: What are the respondents intuition about
 common knowledge? Do they really reason about each other's knowledge as
 modeled in epistemic logic? How well do the respondents do in terms of
 payoffs, i.e.
 how optimised are their strategies?

Instructions to player (requires formatting layout of screencaps)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental setup is facilitated through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
 After accepting the Amazon Mechanical Turk ‘hit’ all participants are asked
 to provide informed consent during the registration process.
 Upon being provided with a link to a UCPH-server at https://cibs.mef.sc.ku.dk
 and entering the experimental platform, participants wait until the choice
 room is available.
 A web page appears showing the following:

\begin_layout Subsection
Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment involves two key questions and five supplementary ones.
 Each round involves these two questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is Monday morning, and you have arrived at your workplace at 8:10 am.
 Where will you go? (Either the canteen or the office).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How certain are you that your colleague has made the same choice as you?
 (Very uncertain, slightly certain, somewhat certain, quite certain, very
 certain).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the game is lost because either respondent has lost their initial bonus,
 they are given the question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The game is over.
 Do you think it was your fault it is over, your colleagues fault, or do
 you think it was because of some other reason? (My fault, my colleagues
 fault, other reason)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the game is either over after 10 rounds or is lost, the respondents
 receive the following questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What strategy did you use while playing the game? (Free text)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assume that you prior to the game could have decided a cut-off point with
 your colleage which you would both stick to while giving a 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 
\emph on
certain 
\emph default
estimation of making the same choice.
 This means .meaning that you will only go to the office if you arrive at
 this time or later.
 At what time would this cut-off point be? (Do not know, none of these times,
 8:00, 8:10, 8:20, 8:30, 8:40, 8:50, 9:00, 9:10).

Inclusion and exclusion rules on Mturk

\begin_layout Standard
No player is allowed to play the game more than once which we will secure
 by giving each respondent a permanent qualification which excludes them
 from further participation.

\begin_layout Standard
We only employ one treatment so far, the Canteen Dilemma with a logarithmic
 scoring rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Payoff Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General structure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Respondents receive a participation fee of $2 and an initial $10 bonus.
 Every round they will pay a penalty which is taken out of their bonus depending
 on the choices they make and how certain they are that their colleague
 has made the same choice.
 Payoffs range from $0.01 to $9.21.
 In order to get respondents to answer honestly, logarithmic scoring is
 used as a proper scoring rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

If both players go to the office, their penalty is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(player\_certainty)\cdot2$
\end_inset

.
 If they both go to the canteen it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(player\_certainty)$
\end_inset

.
 If they go to different places it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(1-player\_certainty)\cdot2$
\end_inset

.
 We expect that many will lose their entire bonus, while other's might keep
 some of their bonus if their co-player loses all their bonuses early and
 ends the game.

\begin_layout Section
Theoretical Approach and Methods (expectations, probably reduce this, maybe
 brief focus on Theory of Mind instead)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a a few assumptions in our experiment, some stronger than others.
 We strongly expect that respondents always choose to go to the office when
 they arrive at 9:00 am or 9:10 am.
 Our theoretical considerations are modeled in Epistemic Logic.
 Through mostly self-explanatory notation, we can say that for any player
 
\emph on
a
\emph default
, if 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 9:00 am or 9:10 am, it holds that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

, where (
\emph on
late
\emph default
)
\emph on
 
\emph default
is understood atomically as denoting a situation, consisting of a pair arrival
 times, where both players lose if either goes to the canteen.
 In other words, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

 entails that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
will go to the office.
 It's more complicated what 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}\neg(late)$
\end_inset

 entails for 
\emph on
a'
\emph default
s
\emph on
 
\emph default
decision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:50 am.
 She then knows 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40 am or 9:00 am, i.e.
 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
doesn't know if it's too late to go to the canteen or not: 
\begin_inset Formula $\neg K_{a}(\neg late)\land\neg K_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

.
 We can read 
\begin_inset Formula $\neg K_{a}\neg(late)$
\end_inset

 as expressing that 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 considers it possible that it is too late to go to the canteen, written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}(late),$
\end_inset

 given this definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}\varphi:=\neg K_{a}\neg\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing this line of reasoning, assume 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:40 am.
 In this case, 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
knows 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:40 or 8:50, which means he knows it is not too late to go
 to the canteen: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
doesn't know if 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
knows this, since she considers it possible that 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrived at 8:50 am, in which case 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
would not know if it is too late to go to the canteen, so we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K_{a}}}{\hat{K_{b}}}(late)$
\end_inset

 or otherwise expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula ${K_{a}}\neg E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
knows it's not too late to go to the canteen, but he does not know if 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 knows this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar reasoning applies for 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arriving at 8:30 am.
 In this case we have 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

 and given that 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 can arrive at 8:40 am at the latest, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{b}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
knowing this epistemic fact: 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}K_{b}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

.
 This implies 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 knows that both 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
knows it's not too late to go to the canteen, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg late).$
\end_inset

 But if 
\emph on
b
\emph default
 arrives at 8:40, it holds that everyone knows it's not too late to go to
 the canteen, but that not everyone knows this very fact! I.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg late)\land\neg E_{\{a,b\}}E_{\{a,b\}}(\neg late)$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, while there are many situations where 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}\neg(late)$
\end_inset

, there is no situation where this is common knowledge, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\{a,b\}}\neg(late)$
\end_inset

 is false for all possible situations in the Canteen Dilemma.
 However, we do not hypothesize that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\{a,b\}}\neg(late)$
\end_inset

 is necessary for a person to choose to go the canteen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset

The interesting aspect is what knowledge will be sufficient for a player
 to go to the canteen.
 If player 
\emph on
a
\emph default
 arrives at 8:50, she will consider it possible that it is too late to go
 to the canteen, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

.
 We might think that
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

 entails that 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
will go to the office.
 But if 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
arrives at 8:40 am, she will consider it possible that 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
considers it possible that it's too late: 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}\hat{K}_{b}(late)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\emph on
b 
\emph default
reasons like 
\emph on
a
\emph default
, then 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
would have to go to the office when arriving at 8:40 as well.
 While we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

 entails 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
going to the office, it's not so certain if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}(late)$
\end_inset

 entails it as well, or if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{{K}}_{a}\hat{K}_{b}(late)$
\end_inset

 does or how many iterations are enough for a person to go to the canteen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This line of reasoning does not fit well with everyday reasoning.
 We expect respondents to be limited to around 2 levels of social reasoning.
 Even if a respondent knows that there is no common knowledge about arriving
 before 9:00 am, they also do not expect others to be aware of this fact,
 meaning they would have to go to the canteen before 9:00 am as well.
 We can assert a few simpler claims however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can assert that any strategy in our games which includes going to the
 canteen, also includes the risk for players to go to different places.
 We can also assert that if two players were to choose to go the canteen
 at all, the optimal cut-off point would be as close to 9:00 am as possible,
 i.e.
 8:50 am, in order to maximise the amount of possible canteen-canteen pairs
 of arrival times.
 We ask respondents how certain they are that their colleague makes the
 same choice as them, which might aid us in avoiding conclusions about fixed
 bounds on social cognition, i.e.
 respondents can reason up to order 
\emph on
n 
\emph default
but not
\emph on
 n +
\emph default
1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an interesting aspect of the game which might support office-only
 strategies.
 If both players go to the office with a 'very certain' estimate every time,
 they will be certain to get a bonus of $9.80.
 If players arrive before 9:00 am at all times and go to the canteen with
 a 'very certainty' estimate, they get a bonus of $9.90, only $0.10 more than
 the safe 
\emph on
office only
\emph default

 And any strategy involving going to the canteen is likely to be given times
 at 8:50 am and 9:00 am, where a 'very certain' estimate results in large
 penalties.

To re-iterate, the only strong assumption we have is that for any agent
 
\emph on
m
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{m}(late)$
\end_inset

 entails that 
\emph on
m 
\emph default
will go to the office.
 Besides that, we assume that players will reason 1-3 levels of theory of
 mind, i.e.
 going to the office at 8:30 am the earliest.
 Going to the canteen at 8:40 am with a certainty estimate that is smaller
 than the estimate given at 8:00 am does suggest some type of social reasoning
 as well however.

Research literature on eliciting belief also show that forecasts elicited
 from observers through proper scoring rules are significantly more accurate
 and calibrated then those elicited from observers using an improper scoring
 rule.
 Calibrated is defined as such:
